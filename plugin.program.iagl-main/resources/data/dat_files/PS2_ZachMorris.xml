		<plot>CIA agent Zoe Nightshade, a mole in Identicon Corporation, based in Hong Kong, is discovered and captured. Identicon, a botanical research firm, is a possible front for a weapons-smuggling ring. James Bond infiltrates the facility in an attempt to rescue her, as well as retrieve a suspicious courier case in the same building. After freeing Nightshade from a submarine set to launch, the pair flee the facility with the courier case. Nigel Bloch, the head of Identicon, has his forces chase the agents through the streets of Hong Kong. The two steal a second case of vials from a nearby Identicon factory. They then rendezvous with R, who provides Bond with a gadget-laden BMW Z8. A limousine pulls up, as an assassin inside launches a rocket at the agents, killing Zoe, and steals the case. Bond gives chase, stopping an armored van which contained the stolen vials.[CR]The vials contain nine blood samples, eight of which contained blood of world leaders. One contains the blood of British diplomat Reginald Griffin, serving in Romania, who is obsessed with protecting a room, outside of his jurisdiction, in the embassy. Bond investigates the embassy, finding Griffin dead, before a similar-looking man attacks him. After overcoming him, Bond finds a message from Bloch on Griffin's computer that mentions Malprave Industries, based in Switzerland. Bond takes the information from the computer and escapes.</plot>

		<plot>Players take the role of the darker, grittier James Bond in Quantum of Solace, the first 007 game from publisher Activision.

Gameplay features plenty of gun-fighting and hand-to-hand combat, as well as surveillance and stealth sequences. The game is built on Infinity Ward's Call of Duty 4 game engine, and features similar graphical quality, third-person cut-aways, and enemy AI.</plot>

		<plot>ATV Offroad Fury 4 is the fourth and final game in the 'Offroad Fury' franchise, released on Playstation 2.[CR]Unlike the previous three titles in the series, this game strays from just simply ATV's in it's roster of vehicles. Offroad Fury 4 introduces MX bikes, dune buggies, and trophy tricks into the mix. The game also differs from it's predecessors in that it includes long point-to-point tracks, which utilize streaming technology to immerse the player in a huge seemingly-endless world. The other notable departure from the previous titles is the inclusion of a career mode, which attempts to include a story between races using rendered cutscenes.</plot>

		<plot>This sixth installment in the Ace Combat series is a prequel to Ace Combat 5 that tells about the Belkan War eluded to in Unsung War. The story is told through the eyes of a reporter, 15 years after the altercation, uncovering secrets about the Belkan War of how it led to war, the outcome of the nuclear detonations within their borders and a near disastrous secret that nearly led to the destruction of a nation.[CR]The main game mode is the story mode, in which the player takes control of an Ustio mercenary pilot, call-sign "Demon Lord", taking part of the said war, advancing missions and advancing in the story while doing it. The missions can be anything done airborne, and there'll be escort, assault and defence missions amongst others. Like in the previous games, the game isn't about simulation, but fast paced aerial combat in highly powered aircraft. More like Top Gun, and less like real world.</plot>

		<plot>Aeon Flux is a 3rd person action game inspired by the 2005 movie of the same name. The story takes place 400 years in the future after the majority of Earth's population has been wiped out by industrial disease. Only one city, Bregna, remains. The city is run by the group of scientists who had discovered the vaccine to prevent the disease, but a group of rebels known as the Monicans oppose their rule. [CR]You control the main character of the story, Aeon Flux. Aeon is a skilled fighter, and can perform light and heavy strikes, combo attacks, and a variety of acrobatic attacks. When an enemy has only a small amount of health left, you also have the ability to perform a takedown attack; when successful this will award you a bonus, such as extra health. Aeon has a health meter and a style meter; when the health meter is depleted, the game is over. The style meter is filled by attacking or killing enemies; when you have earned enough style, you can charge up your combo attacks for extra damage.</plot>

		<plot>Progress through the career mode, where you must complete objectives (such as grind a certain object(s) to jump over large gaps and gain points) to open up further arenas, which there are 7 in all, and once your bored with them, you can make your own in the park editor. The game doesn't use a hard time limit but the so-called "juice meter": it fills up when performing stunts and if it gets empty, the level ends. During the game you level up your character in seven stats, e.g. speed and grinds. The game uses a "learning by doing" approach to this, meaning that the stat improves if you perform the associated actions often enough. There are also five hidden keys in each level which open up new areas within the level.</plot>

		<plot>Fly with the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Element squadrons as you defend country and, eventually, Earth itself from attack. Pilot aircraft that span sixty years of aviation including WWII prop planes, Korean War jets, rare prototypes, and even aircraft from previous Konami games like the Vic Viper and TwinBee.[CR]Between missions you can explore the base and talk to wingmates, buy new aircraft and special weapons, modify or repaint existing aircraft, and get mission briefings. Missions can have varied objectives, but any enemy crafts shot down will reward money used to buy, modify, and repair aircraft. While Ken Thomas is the main character of the game, other pilots can be used in missions as the game progresses, and using them can open up bonus missions as well as alter the story. The player can only play as Delta Squadron pilots, but the story is told from the perspective of both E.D.A.F.'s Delta Squadron and their O.C.C. Ace counterparts. Medals are awarded to each pilot as they reach milestones, such as number of enemy aces shot down or number of aircraft purchased.</plot>

		<plot>Based on the successful television show, Alias lets players take on the role of Sydney Bristow, a stealth operative working for the CIA. The game sets the player against two of Bristow's enemies from the original series in a plot which takes her from Saudi Arabia to Rio de Janeiro as she aims to find out about a mysterious device known only as "The Machine". The game was devised in conjunction with the writers from the show and uses official costumes, character shots and voices.[CR]Players can use a stealth or action approach to get through the levels. With stealth Bristow needs to hug walls and use the correct timing to approach enemies from behind and knock them out. To accomplish this she has a few gadgets to her disposal, e.g. thermal vision or mini cameras. For the more direct method she uses guns found on neutralised enemies or melee combat. The latter knows different fighting styles depending on which weapon Bristow uses, e.g. knifes, unarmed or even a broom. There are also basic puzzles to solve, e.g. opening doors or a hacking mini game. Health regenerates automatically after a certain amount of time.</plot>

		<plot>Alter Echo is a third-person action game with a focus on close quarters combat. It is set in the 29th century where a substance named Multiplast replaces all known construction materials because it can be formed into anything. But something is wrong on the planet Proteus, the only known source of Multiplast. Now the simple worker Nevio has to investigate and stop the megalomaniac shape shifter Paavo who controls an even more powerful substance.[CR]Luckily soon after the beginning of the game Nevo gets his hands on a special suit, which allows him to morph into three forms. The sword form is for melee combat, in which combos can be triggered by using the correct button combinations. The cannon form is a big robot which is more suited for gunplay and the stealth form is a futuristic lizard with a long tongue. During combat the player can instantly switch between the forms, which allows for many combinations depending on the former action or movement. This gets rewarded with plasma points which are used to upgrade Nevio's life energy, new moves or better weapons.</plot>

The game was released on December 4, 2007 and was the first release by short-lived video game company Brash Entertainment.[1] It follows The Chipmunks as they play their way from small venues (such as a high school prom or a civic center) to massive crowds at Burning Munk and ultimately Rockathonapalooza. The soundtrack features 40 popular songs, including "All the Small Things" by Blink-182, "It's Tricky" by Run-D.M.C., and "Heartbreak Hotel" by Elvis Presley. The gameplay itself is similar to other rhythm games such as Rock Band and Guitar Hero. Jason Lee reprised his role as David Seville in the story cutscenes while Ross Bagdasarian, Jr. and Janice Karman reprise their roles from the 1980s-2000's cartoons.</plot>

		<plot>Complete with a computer generated Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell, with trademark insults, American Idol is a music-based, rhythm-action game that will allow you to create, style, and train a contestant for the competition. Once styled and trained you'll see your contestant progress through the auditions, various heats, and then, hopefully, make it to the grand final. You'll need quick fingers as you match the right combination of buttons to what's displayed on the screen helping your contestant sing a sweet harmony and dance to the rhythm of the song. Get it wrong and your voice fades and goes out of tune as the judges and later the audience grow unsettled.</plot>

		<rom name="ps2-redump-usa-chd-part-A/Ape Escape - Pumped &amp; Primed (USA).chd" size="3294423379"/>
		<plot>The game consists of a series of minigames. The minigames consist of either: battling on teams or not with the normal gadgets, kind of like playing an Ape escape version of Super smash bros., but 3-D; battling underwater using submersibles, (unless you're the pipotron which use evil sharks), using only torpedoes; Foot racing to the finish line, using any gadget you can (you may kill the opponents to win, but the level won't end until someone finishes the race); Collecting more coins than the opponents, you may also use gadgets; Collecting coins again, but this time the map moves on its own and you have to use the Dragonfly to get across the level alive; Battling in tanks, using only missiles; or finally racing on boats or rafts (except for the pipotron which use sharks again), plus you may only use missiles to attack.[CR]If you beat the game you may use any gadgets on certain ones. If not, than all minigames will not allow you to use one or no gadgets until the Subfinals. You may not play against bosses or in the Virus-tech World in Verses mode. You may only use up to four gadgets in minigames that allow gadgets, and you may win new prizes from fans which all come from previous Ape Escape games if you win in certain times or with a certain amount of points or coins depending on the minigames. The Prize can be the 3rd prize Fan ID, the 2nd prize Fan letter, or the 1st prize present which could be a new summoning, gadget, vehicle, or clothing. The Gadget could be fiery, electrical, or icy and the vehicle can only be icy.[CR]The Summonings are monkeys, that you gain by getting fan prizes, are used to help you win Levels where you're on foot. They can do things like heal you, cause a sandstorm, attack the opponent directly, etc. Each summoning can only do one thing and you can only have one summoning. Not all summoning came from previous games but two summoning came from the Freaky Monkey Five![CR]After the Subfinals you may use specials by combining buttons next to each other. Each Characters have different specials. For example, The regular Pipo monkey's strongest special is the RC car and the Stunclub combined and it causes you to throw a banana straight forward, and if it hits an enemy then several monkeys jump out of nowhere and beat up the enemy senseless. It won't always KO in one hit.[CR]You also can fight each other in story mode. There are many place to fight. You can use 5 types of cool gadgets. Such as Stunclub for hitting target, Hoops for make you run super fast, Slingshoot for shooting target from far, Dragonfly for you to fly. And car for bomb your target.</plot>

		<plot>This game is based on the animated Adult Swim show Aqua Teen Hunger Force, featuring the crime fighting trio of food items Master Shake, Frylock and Meatwad.[CR]Frylock had been admitted into the prestigious and exclusive Jersey Pines golf course... while Shake was rejected (he didn't actually apply, but that doesn't stop him from complaining about it). So, Shake decides to challenge Frylock in a game of golf just to prove that he's just as worthy as Frylock to be playing on that golf course. Who cares that Shake has no clue how to play golf? He's angry.[CR]The game plays like a mix between a quite simplified golf simulator, an action game and has golf cart racing elements thrown in for good measure.[CR]The game features lots of extras as well, such as 4 full episodes of the show (one of which is unaired), artwork and movie clips.</plot>

		<plot>The story of Ar tonelico: Melody of Elemia takes place in the world of Sol Ciel, a world consisting of two floating islands connected by the Tower of Ar tonelico. Long ago people had built up a great civilization under the guidance of the goddesses the Trio of Elemia, but over the years things have changed; there were two disasters that have lead towards the destruction of the world. In the first disaster most of the lands and skies were lost, in the second the super civilization was lost; now in the third era another disaster is beginning. Viruses born in the Altar of Apostles have begun to appear, though normally not in physical form have now taken on the form of monsters and could destroy the world. In the upper levels of the Tower is a city called Platina where the Knights of Elemia reside; their job is to control virus outbreaks to preserve the tower. One such knight is Lyner Barsett; the main character of the story, he will need to go on a quest to find the Hymn Crystal which can save the Tower of Ar tonelico and the whole world.</plot>

		<plot>The setting for the game is the same as the previous game: the planet of Ar Ciel, albeit centered on a different region this time. The Tower of Ar tonelico from Metafalss is different from the tower in the first game since it doesn't look like a tower initially, but still has some of the same essential facilities (Rinkernator, Plasma Bell (represented as the Lift Generators) and Musical Corridor). The Song Magics are still used like programs, but in this tower there are two Song Magic servers: the Sol Marta server and the Infel Phira Server. The Sol Marta server is located in the upper zone of the tower, acting like a stationary satellite. It is collocated with the S. P. U. and Rinkernator and is the main server for the tower. The Infel Phira server is located in a satellite that orbits the sky around the tower and shares its name with said server. The Sol Marta satellite is a relay station used to increase the range of Song Magic usage of the first tower, so it works with the same kind of hymmnos and executes the EXEC variety of hymns. Plus, it also has the function of receiving energy from the first tower and sending it to the second tower. On the other hand, the Infel Phira server works with another kind of hymmnos called the Pastalia hymmnos, and executes the METHOD variety of hymns.</plot>

		<plot>SCE takes the Arc the Lad series away from its roots and into an Online-playable action-adventure game. Players become a hunter who must travel the world and take on jobs, usually revolving around taking out enemies in real time using magic and special abilities. Collect cards from battle and events and equip them to gain new skills, all the while following an RPG-like storyline. You view the action from overhead, with a camera zooming in and out depending on the intensity of the action and occasionally switching to other angles for dramatic effect. You attack enemies in real time, tapping X once for a simple attack and repeatedly for a combo. You can also guard against attack, dash at an enemy, and press a button to run about the play field faster. The game places heavy emphasis on magic use, with the magic meter recovering automatically and quickly following each spell.</plot>

		<plot>Arc: Twilight of the Spirits is the fourth entry in the Arc the Lad series. Like its two immediate predecessors, the game has tactical battles which allow free positioning and movement of the characters on the combat field. However, the game is closer to being a "regular" Japanese-style role-playing game rather than a tactical RPG. The player controls a relatively small party (up to six active combatants), and is able to explore towns and dungeons in a standard RPG fashion. In the beginning, the game puts the player into control of Kharg, but afterwards the chapters alternate between the human hero and Darc, each with his own party. Characters can use a variety of techniques, accumulating SP (spirit points) in battles and them using them to learn special attacks.</plot>

		<plot>Arena Football is a simulation of the sport of the same name. It shares many similarities with the Madden Series, whose engine it uses, but has a different play-style thanks to Arena football's rather different rules. The game is played indoors with teams of eight on a 50-yard field and the sidelines and uprights have barriers to make balls that would go out of bounds in standard American football bounce back into the play field. It is still considered live at this point. Obviously, this makes the game much faster-paced and higher-scoring.[CR]Features include a coach's pick which will recommend plays, a telemetry view, which lets you see how tired both your players and the opposing ones are along with passing routes so you can set good match-ups, a quick play mode, a season mode, which allows you to go up to 20 seasons and trade players, set salaries, etc, practice and online play.[CR]Arena Football is officially licensed by the Arena Football League and includes all the teams and players from the 2006 season. New Orleans VooDoo is not included as they sat this season out due to hurricane Katrina, though their logo is available to use for created teams. Numerous historic teams are also available.</plot>

The player's job as Sarge and sometimes Vikki is to destroy the serum, eliminate Tan soldiers, and capture Plastro and Tannenberg (and as Sarge sometimes have to rescue Vikki as she has a knack for getting into trouble.)</plot>

		<plot>The once tranquil land of Barbaria has been cursed. Clouded under a dark shroud of death and disease, the world is slowly being eaten alive. The man responsible, a powerful wizard named Zaugg, has convinced the people throughout the land that there is no hope for their existence, and that his rule is the one and only.[CR]But there is a prophecy. The foretelling of a great Barbarian warrior who will rise up against the wizard Zaugg and bring balance to the land. Alas what identity will the legendary warrior take? Could it be the revenge-minded Dagan of Dolok? Or maybe Magnus, Lord of the Undead; perhaps even Zaugg's own apprentice Corath will be the end of the spiteful necromancer. The answer is not clear, but that is where you come in. Assuming the role of 10 unique combatants, it is your duty to defeat the monstrous soul and finally give a happy ending to this sad, twisted story.</plot>

		<plot>The Bard is a cynical, opportunistic musician who roams the country in search of carnal pleasures. However, this impatient and selfish fellow is compelled to accept the greatest quest of his life: save the princess Caleigh from a demonic cult that has kidnapped her. The unlikely hero must now explore the land in search of the princess, accompanied by the omnipresent Narrator who obviously can't stand the Bard and uses every opportunity to sarcastically comment on his actions. Furthermore, Fionnaoch, the mysterious abductor of the princess, does everything he can to stop the Bard, sending his minions after him.[CR]A self-proclaimed "quest for coin and cleavage", The Bard's Tale is an action RPG that is more of a whimsical take on role-playing games than a remake of the classic series. As the Bard, players can fight off hordes of foes with blade and bow, and summon companions through magical Bard Songs. Leveling up allows the player to raise the character's main attributes and invest specialization points in the different types of weapons he can use. Magical companions must be sought out and then summoned during battles. After being summoned, they act pretty much like AI-controlled party members; some of them specialize in physical attacks and offensive spells, while others can heal the hero.[CR]During conversations the player can choose "nice" or "snarky" responses for the protagonist. While mostly used for humorous effect, some of these responses may affect subsequent events. The game uses the Dark Alliance engine and has a similar camera and control scheme.</plot>

		<plot>Based on the cartoon series rather the comic books or the movies, Batman: Vengeance puts you in the role of the 'Dark Knight' in a 3D Gotham City, in order to face and fight enemies; such as Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, and, yes, The Joker.[CR]The Joker has died after falling from a bridge mid-scuffle with our caped hero. With the big man's place at the top of the criminal hierarchy up for grabs, the city's most heinous villains are out in force, clambering over each other for the new employment opportunity. Batman's most dangerous opponents are causing a crime wave the likes of which Gotham has never seen. Nothing is as it seems. You can't even be sure that the infamous Joker has really ceased to exist. Gotham's safety hangs in the balance and only Batman can save it.</plot>

		<plot>In this adaptation of the film of the same name, the origins of the Batman legend are explored. Playing as both Bruce Wayne and his alter-ego, Batman, you will need to hunt evil forces in familiar locations such as Arkham asylum, Gotham City, but also in the Himalaya. Using both stealth and brutal skills, you take on enemies in true beat-em-up style. Batman has a vast array of moves, from kicks and punches to more exotic special moves. Multiple enemies can be attacked at once, and there are tricks to break through enemies' defenses. Also, certain attacks can only be used as a finishing move when opponents are weakened.[CR]Next to the melee combat, Batman carries his Bat Utility Belt with a Batgrapple to reach higher areas, the Batarang and gadgets such as smoke and flash grenades, a lockpick, camera hacker and an optical wire to peek from behind corners.</plot>

Vehicles like the Humvees, tanks, APCs and helicopters all make it into the game although fixed wing aircraft are noticeable absent.[CR]Multiplayer allows up to 24 players battle it out in a Conquest mode where you capture flags and maintain control of them until the enemy tickers run down, or Capture the Flag which is all out attack to get the enemy flag back to your own base. A single player campaign, which is story led, see's China and USA go up against each other in Kazakhstan. Throughout the single player campaign you switch between China and USA armies as you follow orders based on news reports which show both sides of the war giving you a view of how war is and how it's reported. The new Hot Swap feature allows you to jump into almost any other allied troop on the battlefield which saves loads of running and gets you into the best position for your next attack or defense.</plot>

		<plot>For the most part, gameplay across the seven included worlds is a balance of action and puzzle-solving that revolves around the skills of Ben's alien forms. For example, Ben might need to change into his Humungousaur form to break through doors, or use his Swampfire form to ignite flammable substances. Each form has different combinations and special attacks that it can execute, and Ben can unlock new abilities by defeating enemies and collecting glowing energy orbs. However, there is one gameplay element that players should be aware of: using a form's innate abilities drains energy from Ben's Omnitrix meter, preventing them from continually being used until the meter can recharge. As a result, players will need to focus on combos and save their special attacks for finishing blows instead of constantly wielding them in battle.</plot>

		<plot>On Mars, a battle wages on between the race of mice, known as the Martian Freedom Fighters, and the invading Catatonian Empire. Both sides are fighting for the rights of one important machine: the Regenerator. This machine has the ability to terraform Mars, creating a safehaven for all mice. The Catatonians wish to claim it so they can take over the planet. Freedom Fighter General Stoker is the only one who knows how to build the Regenerator. As a result, he is not present on the battlefield, but is instead on Earth looking for molecules vital to the device's construction.[CR]The mice later mysteriously lose contact with Stoker, so another general, Carbine, sends the Biker Mice from Mars. After their arrival, they land in Chicago and meet up with Charley Davidson, who runs and owns the Last Chance Garage, which becomes the Biker Mice's base of operations. Not long afterwards do they realize the Catatonians, led by General Hairball and Cataclysm, have come to Earth in search of Stoker, so that they can ensure their claim of the Regenerator. Evil billionaire Ronaldo Rump (a parody of Donald Trump and Ricky Ricardo with an oversized butt) also seeks Stoker, since he owns a Regenerator of his own, and uses it for his evil money-making schemes, but it is running low on power.</plot>

		<plot>Blitz: The League is the first football game with no NFL license in many years - because EA signed an exclusive deal with the NFL, Midway developed one without the license. The game has 17 fantasy teams all with their own look and feel - from personalities to logos. [CR]The game differentiates itself further from official games by giving the players an off-field presence, often involving sex, performance-enhancing drugs and violence. The game has input from the writer for Playmakers, the football-based soap opera the NFL forced ESPN to cancel.[CR]Blitz: The League has 8-man teams, and makes spectacular action-packed moves easier than in real life. Impressive moves boost your Clash meter, which allows you to pull off unrealistic moves, such as easier running due to Bullet Time, and some brutally tough defences tackles. If these tackles happen frequently enough the players will fight hockey-style, lunging into wild tackles. The team with the most tackles from this gains the Unleashed mode, which has even more gruesome moves, of a style the NFL would not allow to be associated with their product.[CR]Additional features include multiplayer action with head-to-head online play and complete customization options of players, teams, stadiums and more. Lawrence Taylor appears as the poster boy.</plot>

		<plot>The Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen 2 is a third person action game with adventure elements, more similar in perspective to Soul Reaver than the first Blood Omen game. The player controls from behind Kain's shoulder and can move him in different directions, attack, jump, use "dark gifts" and grab on to ledges. Kain's life energy steadily depletes and must be replenished constantly by drinking blood. Blood is found by consuming any living creature nearby, often requiring defeating an enemy through combat first. As Kain consumes blood, his meter is filled up. Once full, Kain gains additional health. Kain also learns new dark gifts throughout the game, by defeating boss creatures. Some gifts include: the ability to blend into mist, fire projectiles, use projectile telekinesis or make a great horizontal leap. Many of these abilities can be used to perform "stealth kills" which will instantly defeat a foe. Kain will fight using his bare hands, or by picking up daggers, swords, axes and other weapons. These weapons all attack differently, eventually breaking, and can also be thrown at enemies from afar.</plot>

		<plot>In this combat adventure, players take the role of a hero whose hands and feet are lethal weapons -- quite literally. Hyakkimaru is missing several of his natural body parts, which have been replaced by blades, guns, and other weaponry. His natural limbs were taken by demons, and he is on a quest to take them back. The fast-paced hack-and-slash action is strung together on a fairly thick storyline, which is told through extensive pre-rendered cut scenes. A two-player mode is also included, which puts the second gamer in control of Hyakkimaru's companion Dororo, a small girl with some big attack moves. Blood Will Tell is based on the manga series by Osamu Tezuka, the influential Japanese artist who may be best known to Western audiences as the creator of Astro Boy.</plot>

		<plot>In the FMV, Rayne is first seen staring at a place on fire. The next scene happens before the fire. Rayne is seen entering a library (called Blood library), with a few Nazis inside. Knowing Kagan is here (who is an influential Nazi collaborator), she declares she is here to kill him. Kagan notices she is here, but is not moved by her presence. He knows it is his offspring (but does not know her name), but says she smells "tainted", asking who was her mother. He does not know her mothers name, saying he is "terrible with names", but does not care, knowing she died with her family. He appears pre-occupied, looking for something. He finds what he was looking for, called the "Vesper Shard". Knowing Rayne still wants to kill him, he then brings Professor Trumain up from the floor, severely beaten, showing his own small intestine around his neck. Kagan knows that they know each other, and that Trumain "stole" yet another offspring from him. During his talk, he speculates that the Brimstone Society knew the Vesper Shard's powers, and was eventually going to kill their Vampire allies such as Rayne. Trumain then pulls out a detonator, first giving time for Rayne to run, then detonates the grenade.</plot>

		<plot>During the XGC (X-Genome Code) Incident one year ago, riots raged over the earth by beasts that did not show the XCG, and all over the country small earthquakes shook the land. The cause was unknown, but as the Crest Incident came to an end and the rioting and earthquakes subsided, people began to claim that all was due to the influence of the Stone Seal. Although the Stone Seal has been locked away, the rioting and earthquakes have returned. This time, the incidents are on a larger scale than those of a year ago. What could be behind it all?[CR]Bloody Roar 4 is the last title in the series, and is once again a full-3D fighting game featuring the series' trademark transformation abilities. Unlike previous titles in the series, the beast gauge now acts as its own health bar; if a character's health gauge is depleted, they will automatically transform. The game features 18 playable fighters and a variety of game modes, including standard arcade, versus, time-attack, training, and survival modes. Of special mention is the career mode, in which fighting battles will earn so-called "DNA points," which can be spent on abilities and equipment to customize a character for use in other modes.</plot>

From the main menu, you choose the number of players (single player or two player hot seat), competition type (downhill, super G, and slalom), course, and skis (each one has a different effect on your maneuverability, speed, and tucking). The game itself begins at the gate with a zoomed-in interface where you’ll need to time 3 beeps/flashes to build up power. Each press builds up a percentage -- if you nail all three lights you’ll get 100% power at launch. The game display then switches to an overhead camera focused on your skier, where you use three keypad controls: Left and Right for turning, and OK to tight tuck or recover when off balance. Increasing your turn angle allows you to make tighter turns but at the potential cost of speed.[CR]In Slalom mode, left/right motions are much faster and more sensitive. At the cost of maneuverability, a tight tuck increases your speed and prevents you from slowing down when hitting jumps, but your speed bonus is greater at turns than when you are going straight down the mountain. The energy meter in the top right corner of the screen recharges faster when you are not tucked. In Easy mode you receive time penalties for errors while in Hard mode, errors puts you out of the competition. If you hit the side areas or any obstacles you crash. Crashing ends your race in utter humiliation with some harsh words from Bode himself. At the end of the race the tight tuck button can be double tapped to execute a “reach” for the finish line, which will shave off a small amount of time. “Reaching” takes energy so you’ll want to conserve your energy, and time the maneuver appropriately.[CR]The key to winning the race is through effective turning, quick timing of turns and tucks, and strategic use of energy. Scores can be uploaded after the medal ceremony for an event if you win the Gold Medal. Your scores are entered into an online database that tracks the top scores and skiers. The game also allows you to send the real Bode Miller a text message letting him know that you are rooting for him and be eligible to win one of hundreds of prizes.</plot>

		<plot>Boogie is a dance and Karaoke game. Unlike most similar games, which use special pads to control the dancing, the game does not require an additional peripheral since all the moves were designed for the Dual-Shock 2. Boogie includes a USB microphone for the Karaoke. Each song can be played as a dance or a karaoke game. Players either match the rhythm and pitch, or match the song's beats to dance. Variation and combos are encouraged, as too many similar moves will lower the score. By performing well in the dances, a Boogie meter is filled. When full the player can execute a special move. While dancing, bonus items appear such as multipliers, tokens and meter boosts.[CR]The game features a story mode centered around an intergalactic singing and dancing competition. There are five different characters, each with a unique story. For all other modes of play, players can create custom avatars based upon the five base characters, with a chapter in the story mode for each of them. Token collected during gameplay can be traded in for new songs, stages and outfits. There is also a mode where players can manipulate the camera to record their own music videos.</plot>

		<plot>The gameplay of the Bratz Forever Diamondz is mostly the same as its predecessor, Bratz Rock Angelz. There are four playable characters: Yasmin, Cloe, Sasha and Jade. During the game, all of a sudden blue coins appear, called Blingz, which are money for the Bratz girls. There's a mobile phone menu, where you can read messages, and see the objective, what the player currently has to do.[CR]It has explorable roam, similar to Grand Theft Auto series. When the player is not in an objective, he/she can take a character to collect character coins (which are can be used to buy movie clips. There are 25 for each Bratz girl), Blingz tokens, take pictures, and play mini-games for extra money.The new features in the video game, that there are timed objectives, which means that you have to do the objective in the amount of time. There's an ice rink, where the girls can perform ice-skating skills. The biggest new feature is that the player can adopt a pet (cat or dog), and take him/her to pet shows, accessorize it, etc. The pet helps in certain objectives, however, after that the player should give a treat for it. You can also take part in modeling contests to win Blingz. The mini-games can be activated to go into a place, or talk to a person.</plot>

		<plot>Brave is a young native American boy who lives in the forest. As he wants to become a warrior, the elderly shaman Grey Bear prepares an adventure and hides carvings that will grant him new skills. During the search, however, the village is brutally attacked by the demonic creature Wendigo. Brave is the only one who can defeat it, but in order to do that, he has to track the path of the mysterious shaman Spirit Dancer, discover his past, and find the means to defeat the evil force.[CR]Brave is a 3D third-person platformer with puzzles. Set in worlds with different themes (ice world, volcanic world, wastelands, forest...), Brave can roam freely, but certain parts are only opened up after solving quests. The boy can jump, duck, climb, and do basic attack moves. While observing, for certain actions, and when using ranged weapons, a first-person view is available as well. During the adventure, Brave acquires new abilities, which allow him to track creatures by smell or their tracks, mimic animals' sounds to lure or distract them, summon creatures, or invoke shaman powers to become an animal (an eagle, a bear, a rabbit and even a skunk).</plot>

		<plot>The story is essentially told as a "reflection" on the events that took place earlier, as Army historian Colonel S.L.A. Marshall is interviewing paratroopers 15+ days after D-Day. The story is divided into three parts. The first part of the game is recollection of Hartsock's time in Sergeant Matt Baker's squad during the initial D-Day invasion. The second part picks up when he takes command of 2nd Squad, 3rd Platoon during the liberation and defense of Carentan, and the eventual link up between 82nd and 101st Airborne Division at the town of Baupte. The final part will take place in and around Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte. Although the first part takes place under Baker's command, every mission is one not included in Road to Hill 30. The player commands Desola, Allen, and Garnett from 3rd Squad, and some soldiers from 2nd Squad at first. Then the game switches the player to command the entire 2nd Squad after the Battle of Bloody Gulch (Hill 30).[CR]Hartsock's squad consists of the remains of the original 2nd Squad (Cpl. Franklin Paddock, Pvt. Dean "Friar" Winchell, and Pfc. James Marsh) and the remnants of 1st Squad (Cpl. Jacob Campbell, Pvt. Will Paige, and Pvt. Derrick McConnell). In addition, the player will also be in command of Corporal (later promoted to Sergeant) Seamus Doyle of the 82nd Airborne during the initial D-Day invasion in early parts of the game.</plot>

The Burn Meter is a gauge that is filled by performing reckless stunts, like racing into oncoming traffic, or power-drifting through corners.

		<plot>Burnout is a street racing game focused around speed and crashing. Unlike many games which focus on closed course driving, you get to drive through cities with real traffic and city infrastructure. Designers have built an entire city and surrounding areas, and implement the race courses throughput the countie's streets. As a result, many times certain parts of race-courses interlace with other parts of other races. As well, instead of encouraging strategic driving and safe driving, Burnout strongly encourages offensive driving. Driving on the wrong side of the road, barely missing passing traffic, drifting, and jumps all add to your boost "burnout" meter. Speed boosts and jumps aid your attempt to dive past buses, trucks and anything else that gets in the way. The more offensive and dangerous your driving is, the more boost you get!</plot>

Burnout Dominator is the second spin-off game in the Burnout series and sixth overall. It retains the core gameplay of the series, as players race at top speeds through dozens of World Tour events testing "reckless skill-based" driving techniques. The versions for each platform do not interact with each other.[CR]This is the only Burnout game that was not developed by Criterion Games, and the first Burnout game in the series since Burnout 2: Point of Impact to not feature the "Crash Mode". At the time Dominator was being developed, Criterion was busy working on Burnout Paradise and was waiting to re-introduce the mode in a new form for the latter title. However, Criterion Games are listed as "the makers of this game" in the game manual and credited as developer on the official Electronic Arts site.</plot>

		<plot>Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2009 is all about nonstop danger and fast action - this is a thrilling hunting experience for both hunting enthusiasts and first-person action fans. The stats speak for themselves: the game has 25 of the world’s most dangerous animals, including lions, grizzly bears, Cape buffalo, rhino, jaguars and more in 9 exotic, rugged locations like the South American jungle, Alaskan wilderness, and the Russian tundra. To top it off, ferocious beasts aren't the only way you can meet your maker - you must survive plane crashes and boat down treacherous rivers, as well as avoid avalanches, stampedes, and piranha-infested waters. You play as Flint Abrahams, a seasoned big game hunter on a quest to hunt the world's deadliest trophies. Equipped with Cabela's gear, the most respected outdoor recreation brand in the world, one would think the odds are on your side. But no one has even seen animals this fierce - they will charge you if you miss your shot, then you will be forced to fight them via melee defense. But pay attention, nearby animals may join the attack, which means dire consequences for those without the requisite combination of brawn and pinpoint shooting ability.</plot>

It has its own set of missions involving the U.S. fighting in the Pacific theater and the Battle of the Bulge in Europe, as well as the British advancing on the Rhine River into Germany. This version features 13 missions and no online multiplayer mode. It was developed by Rebellion Developments and published by Activision. Much like the first three Call of Duty titles, Final Fronts received a T rating from the ESRB by toning down the violence. It is the last Call of Duty game to be released on PlayStation 2.</plot>

The karts have different stats, and so do the co-drivers, who have various "toon powers" - such as shields, speed boosts, damage output and flying capabilities.[CR]The game includes various modes typical of racing games, such as tournament mode, battle mode and elimination races, with tournament unlocking new drivers and courses, and bonuses such as full episodes from the various shows. The game allows for 2 player multiplayer.</plot>

		<plot>College Hoops 2K8 is a video game by Visual Concepts and 2K Sports. It was released on November 19, 2007 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3.[CR]The cover features Greg Oden, formerly of the Ohio State Buckeyes.[CR]Almost every school competing in Division I NCAA college basketball at the time was included in 2K8, including recent additions South Carolina-Upstate, Cal State-Bakersfield and Florida Gulf Coast. Not included were Presbyterian College and North Carolina Central, D-1 independents. Also, Centenary College of the Summit League was unlicensed and instead named UL-Calcutta. The game also featured the ability to change and modify rosters and share them online via the newly introduced 2K Share feature. The real coaches feature was dropped from this game, possibly because the coaches chose not to renew their contracts and all of the coaches are unnamed.[CR]The announcers/commentators featured in the game were Verne Lundquist and Bill Raftery. The College Hoops series was put on hiatus in 2008 as 2K Sports declined to seek the college license for a 2K9 release. EA Sports got the contract before 2K did, so EA will continue to make college basketball games. EA discontinued their college basketball game series in 2010. It is currently unknown if 2K Sports will continue to make their College Hoops 2K series.</plot>

		<plot>Combat★Elite: WWII Paratroopers is primarily a top-down close-combat shooter with some RPG features. It can be played in single-player or two-player coop mode. The game lets the player take part as a paratrooper in the allied campaign in Europe during the second world war, starting out as a private soldier from either the US 101st Airborne, the US 82nd Airborne, or the British 1st Airborne regiment.[CR]There are 40 missions strung together with a narrative, depicting the Operation Overlord (D-Day), Bastogne, Operation Market Garden and the Battle of the Bulge and beyond - ending in an fictional effort to stop the Nazis from creating an atomic bomb. During a mission, you find medical packs, ammunition (weapon specific), and new weapons as pickups lying around, or dropped by enemies killed - the drops disappear if not picked up in time. A mission takes place on a series of relatively small maps, separated into 'levels', and at the level transition points the player can save the game, and is also awarded skill points, new ranks and medals.[CR]The RPG aspect includes the initial character specialization, and between missions levels the player get skill points, which can be saved for later or allocated between missions to improve various combat skills:Hand-to-Hand, Pistol, SMG, Rifle, Heavy SMG, Stealth, Medic, Grenade and 'Combat Sense'.[CR]In single-player has classic run-and-gun gameplay. You use a player-centered bird's-eye view, and you must turn the character to spin the view as you can only shoot at enemies at the top of the screen, as opposed to the sniper mode, when you use a 1st person scoped view. The screen has a fixed scaling, there is no zoom or free pan, other than to automatically give you a few seconds look ahead when key locations are nearby. The player is kept in the center of the screen and the view window automatically slides over the battlefield as your character moves. Normally, enemies won't fire until they are within your view - but there are exceptions.[CR]In two-player coop mode, each player can shoot in the direction their character is facing, and do not need to rotate the view to hit the enemy. The players cannot be farther apart than the screen size, which is fixed. The screen is centered between the player characters in this mode. If players are far apart at opposite edges of the screen, they can often be shot at from off-screen enemies, as enemies are triggered by being close enough - about half the screen size away on the map, no matter if you can see them yourself.</plot>

		<plot>It's early 21st century and the majority of the world's countries have created the International Corps for Peace, an organisation dedicated to bringing about world peace. However, not all countries are keen to be involved and these persist in generating conflicts through the organisation GHOST. A secret organisation, which warrants only the economic interests of its members without any attachment to morals, GHOST, does not hesitate to create crisis situations with the goal of destabilising the world-wide equilibrium and endanger any chance of peace.</plot>

		<plot>John Constantine is the name of the main character in the Hellblazer comic by Vertigo DC. This game is based on the movie Constantine, starring Keanu Reeves. The player assumes the role of Constantine, a mage/exorcist/demonslayer of the modern age. A man who fights Evil, but remains cynical and skeptical in the face of Good. He also smokes a lot.[CR]The game is played in third person perspective, switching to first person when the hero enters narrow spaces. Constantine's goal is to discover how and why Demons have managed to physically enter Earth, although the ancient laws forbid it. He utilizes a number of holy weapons and artifacts, from twin revolvers (dubbed the Witch's Curse) that shoot stones from the Holy Lands to Holy Water Bombs and the Cross Shotgun. Constantine can also utilize various kinds of offensive magic powered by the souls of slain demons. Often he will be obliged to travel to Hell, which resembles a perpetually ablaze and decaying version of our world, in order to bypass obstacles. Each level is linear and is played sequentially, following most of the story of the movie with a few sections added in or stretched out to allow for more action. Hidden cards in levels will unlock cutscene animatics, concept art, and interviews with the stars of the film.</plot>

		<plot>Crash: Mind over Mutant continues the storyline of its predecessor, Crash of the Titans. [CR]The Titans from the previous game has broken free from Dr. Cortex' control and has settled down on various places on the Wumpa Islands. But Cortex has teamed up with Nitrus Brio to develop a device which can control both the bandicoots and the Titans. Now Crash and his friends must find out where Cortex is hiding and stop him before he can act out his devious plan. [CR]Crash can use a light-powered attack to defeat smaller enemies, but for bigger enemies, a more high-powered attack is needed. Crash can also block and dodge attacks. Just like in Crash of the Titans, Crash can take control of the Titans which he encounters. But this time he can take the Titans with him and use them when he needs it. As Crash defeats more and more enemies, he can upgrade both his own attacks and the attacks of the Titans in his possession.[CR]The Co-Op Experience:[CR]Your co-op partner is Crash's sister, Coco, playable for the first time in the cooperative mode. Not only does Coco make the game more inviting to pick up and play, she also brings with her a new tactile "treasure hunt" ability where one co-op partner can "jack" on the other and ride as gunner, using different ammo.</plot>

All graphics are in 3D, and the sound is typical for cartoon games like this. The whole game is pretty straightforward in design, getting stuck on a puzzle is not really possible.</plot>

Card types range from monster cards (e.g. Skeleton), which are used to accumulate territory on the board to increase your mana; Equipment (e.g. Chain Mail), which will boost your monsters' abilities when they battle; and Magic (e.g. Holy Word 0), which can be used to help you or hinder the other players on the board. When a player lands on another player's monster, he/she can challenge it to a battle in an attempt to take over the territory. If the attacker wins, he/she gets the space on the board and additional mana.</plot>

For many, the creation of the Virtuaroids (VR) began a new age as the 49-foot mechanical giants gained the attention of everyone and anyone nearby. Noticing this, business makers used the opportunity to create a new form of entertainment upon the surface of Mars. Known as Limited War, the performances drew crowds the universe over. It wasn't until corporate greed appeared once more that things began to fall out of control.[CR]Those in power began to fight each other for a stake in the new events, leading to internal fighting and crime. A special investigations unit was formed, in hopes it would eliminate such crime and bring order back. They are known as 'MARZ', and as a member of that team you must use your new found position to your advantage.[CR]In each mission, you will control your own VR and must defend or attack a number of key locations and other VR units. Over time you will gain new additions to the machines armour and weapons which will aid you in later missions. You'll also unlock bigger and more powerful VR's as well.</plot>

		<plot>With Dance Factory you can create a choreographed routine for any CD in your collection. Using a spectral analysis system, the game will generate a step routine for each song that is average length. Dance Factory comes with five licensed tracks ranging from Tim MacGraw's "I Like It, I Love It" to the Pussycat Dolls tribute to home wreckers in "Don't Cha." The game comes with three dance difficulties such as easy, normal, and pro flavors, and the object is to hit the arrows on the dance mat at the correct time. As you hit the arrows, you will be informed if your step was bad timing, pretty good, or perfect. Increasing your accuracy unlocks bonus combos, and by filling the rank meter you can increase your score and change the animated visuals in the background. [CR]Dance Factory includes five modes of play to entertain and exercise your body and brain. "Normal" mode has you dancing through one song while endurance mode challenges you to dance through an entire album. "Fitness" mode does not keep score, but counts calories that are lost as you boogie to the beat. "Record" mode allows you to save your custom dance routines for later use, and "EyeToy Camera" mode lets you see your movements and also adds two extra steps that you execute by using your hands. "Creature" mode will access bebop beasts that are hiding in music CDs everywhere. The creatures dance in the background as you cut a rug, and credits earned can be used to accessorize your new friend with sunglasses, jewelry, portable radios, and more. Challenge your friends to a den dance-off with a multiplayer option for up to 16 jivers.</plot>

		<plot>Promising over 100 hours of gameplay, Dark Angel: Vampire Apocalypse is one of the longest adventures on the PlayStation 2. Set in the year 1640, players assume the role of Anna, the Dark Angel of Retribution. Though he was defeated a century ago, the monsters and demons faithful to the Shadow Lord have begun preparations for his resurrection. Anna has exactly one year to prepare for the battle with this demonic entity, and in this time she must explore three distinct villages and six unique battlegrounds, slaying all the creatures she comes across. An action-RPG that borrows elements from the likes of Diablo, Dark Angel: Vampire Apocalypse presents players with a wide array of equipment and an arsenal of weapons -- both, projectile-based and melee-oriented -- to collect. [CR]Weapons are bound to the controller's four face buttons, allowing players to combine items as desired. The requisite meters allow you to monitor health, spirit, and experience levels as well as your current stash of gold. Spanning three separate races, the hordes of monsters all succumb to different weapons you have at your disposal. Broadswords for example, are particularly effective against the Undead. The storyline is purposely non-existent, with nothing in the way of cut-scenes, and minimal character interaction to reveal more of the plot. Players are free to do as the please with little in terms of specific objectives to complete. You simply have to build Anna's abilities for the duration of a year, and ensure that she will be strong enough when the time comes for her to face the Shadow Lord.</plot>

		<plot>Dark Summit's controls resembles many other skateboarding and snowboarding games of the time. The user is able to grind/jib, grab, flip (both horizontal and vertical) and do special tricks on the mountain in general and special half-pipe tricks on the alien halfpipe and the chairlift halfpipe.[CR]Different areas in this game are accessed by chairlift, and unlocked by having a certain amount of "Lift Points" which are earned by doing missions. Cosmetics and snowboard upgrades are unlocked by having "Equipment Points". These are earned by doing tricks around the mountain. Special tricks and combos earn more "Equipment Points". "Lift Points" and "Equipment Points" are not spent as such, they are actually accumulated and for every milestone, the player unlocks a new cosmetic, snowboard upgrade or new area.[CR]There are 4 different snowboards in the game that players can unlock by earning "Equipment Points". The starting boards offers no advantage over the others, and will quickly obsolete to the user. Only very skilled players can use the starting board in the late game, as jumps and tricks are difficult to accomplish quickly. The next board allows the player to navigate quickly and perform jumps easier, making it easier for the user to get down the mountain faster. The third board offers the previous upgrade, as well as the ability to do grabs, flips and spins faster, making combo-trick missions easier to accomplish. Finally, for 2,000,000 equipment points, the player will unlock the final board. This board is by far the best in the game, offering faster speeds, higher jumps, faster grabs and faster spins</plot>

		<rom name="ps2-redump-usa-chd-part-D/Darkwatch (USA).chd" size="2807161750"/>
		<plot>The game's story (narrated by Peter Jason) follows the exploits of Jericho Cross, an outlaw-turned-vampire, and his employment in an ancient vampire-hunting order known as the Darkwatch (hence the game's title). After unwittingly releasing the Darkwatch's greatest enemy, a vampire lord named Lazarus Malkoth, Jericho is conscripted into the Darkwatch as an elite operative. Jericho, however, is slowly turning into a vampire himself, after being bitten by Lazarus. The game outlines either Jericho's struggle for humanity or his descent into darkness, depending on the player's actions.[CR]The game begins in Arizona Territory in 1876 with Jericho attempting to rob a Darkwatch train that is transporting the captured Lazarus Malkoth to the Darkwatch Citadel, a frequently mentioned and often visited location in the game, and in doing so releases Lazarus into the West. In a seeming bit of mercy, Lazarus bites Jericho and gives him the curse of the vampire, causing him to slowly turn into one. The game continues with the introduction of Cassidy as well as the appearance of Shadow, Jericho's undead horse.[CR]As the game progresses, Jericho finally makes his way to the Darkwatch Citadel, where he meets General Clay Cartwright, the current leader of the order. Cartwright puts him through Torture Maze, the Darkwatch initiation exercise which was designed as a test for Darkwatch Regulators, but Jericho gets a special version specially designed by Cartwright to kill him.[7] When Jericho passes the test anyway, he begins to do missions for the Darkwatch. Missions include tasks ranging from fixing some of the damage he has caused to acquiring Darkwatch equipment, such as the Darklight Prism, a stone that allows vampires within its vicinity to use their powers and walk in sunlight. On some of his missions Jericho is accompanied by other Darkwatch forces including his new partner, a sultry and vicious temptress named Tala. Eventually, during their night of passion, Tala causes him to bite her and inherits some portion of his power, transforming herself into a half-vampire creature similar to him.[8] She then betrays the Darkwatch from within, allowing the undead hordes to invade its headquarters.[CR]A final showdown ensues with Lazarus, in which Jericho arises victorious, and a choice is given for him to side with either Cassidy or Tala. Either Jericho rids the west of the Curse of Lazarus, or he becomes the Curse; the player's choice determines how the game ends. If the character were to choose the good option, then the final fight will be against the vampiric Tala, and if they player chose to take Lazarus' curse for himself, then he must fight the ghost of Cassidy. The bad ending shows the now-monstrous Jericho killing Tala and riding into the night, while the good ending shows Cassidy's soul being released.</plot>

		<plot>Nina Williams, world-renowned assassin, has been hired by the CIA and MI6 to join a team which is attempting to infiltrate "Kometa," a notorious criminal organization. The team's strategy involves gaining access to the target through a fighting tournament being held on the "Amphitrite," a luxury cruise ship owned and operated by Kometa.[CR]The game's most remarkable feature is the ability to allow Nina to use her martial arts skills to break the bones of her enemies through use of carefully aimed attacks. These attacks do more damage to the enemy and show the player the damage being inflicted on the opponent's skeletal structure. Strangely, this does little to actually disable opponents, as they often continue to use limbs that have been literally shattered, as well as survive blows to the head that would cause the skull to practically explode, without even losing consciousness.[CR]Once the game is completed, "Anna Mode" will be unlocked, offering the player the ability to play as Nina's younger sibling, Anna. Various outfits can be unlocked throughout the game, which include a bikini, cocktail dress, purple jumpsuit, black and silver stealth suit. Playing the game a second time causes LCD crates throughout the game to contain infinite supplies of certain weapons, such as infinite katana and infinite rail-gun. After completing the game twice, the wrestling costume as seen in the opening FMV is also unlocked. A third clear game file additionally unlocks "Tekken 2 Nina", which instead of an outfit is actually a different facial and bodily construction, exactly as she appears in the Tekken title, in low resolution.</plot>

		<plot>The unlikely combination of Def Jam recording artists and underground wrestling is the subject of this Electronic Arts release, which features the 3D likenesses of such musicians as Ludacris, Redman, DMX, Scarface, Ghostface Killa, Method Man, and more as playable characters. Developed by AKI Corporation, whose previous experience in the genre includes titles WWF No Mercy and WCW/NWO Revenge, Def Jam Vendetta offers an estimated 1,500 animations for each of the 45 included characters. A total of ten different venues are available, and one of the featured modes offers a storyline complete with soap opera-style drama to go along with the suplexes and body slams. Up to four players can compete in Single, Tag-Team, Handicap, or Battle Royale matches.[CR]EA combines the game-making prowess of Aki and the boisterous characters from hip-hop's Def Jam Records. The result is Def Jam Vendetta, a curious concoction that just might have the goods to attract hardcore and mainstream gamers alike. The game features 12 Def Jam artists including Redman, Method Man, Ludacris, DMX, N.O.R.E., and Scarface. As you make your way through the game, you'll be able to unlock all 45 characters plus aditional venues, girls, and concept art.</plot>

		<plot>Defender is an updated version of the classic arcade game of the same name. The Manti bugs have invaded earth and the remaining human survivors now live in colonies throughout the solar system. As more swarms of Manti arrive, even the colonies are now in danger of being wiped out. You've been enlisted to help save the remaining colonists and destroy the Manti bugs! There are a total of six different ships to fly, each with its own flight characteristics and special weapons. Weapon and shield power-ups can also be found throughout the various missions. As in the original version of Defender, the Manti will try to capture any humans they can find to change them into mutants to increase their attack force. To increase chances of success you will need to rescue captured humans before this happens and bring them to a safe landing zone. Saving colonists will also earn you some credits, which can later be used to buy improved weapons or shields for you ship. Also included are several video extras detailing the historical perspective of and the making of Defender.</plot>

		<plot>The game begins with a Furon, Cryptosporidium-136, hovering over a launch site with military personnel testing a rocket. The rocket is launched and destroys the ship carrying Cryptospiridium-136, and leaves him fatally wounded. Crypto-136 is later captured, by the U.S. Army. Some time later, Cryptosporidium-137 travels to Earth with another Furon, Orthopox. Cryptosporidium (nicknamed 'Crypto') comes with the intention of rescuing 136, while Orthropox (nicknamed 'Pox') desires to extract human brain stems for study. Crypto arrives at Turnipseed Farm in the Midwest, where Pox mistakes Cows for Earth's dominant life-form. The Majestic agency is alerted to the Furon presence when Crypto decimates an army brigade passing through the area. Pox, communicating with Crypto through a hologram-like device, then reveals to Crypto that the reason he requires human brain stems is because they contain Furon D.N.A. handed down to them by Furon scouts eons ago when the Furons stopped on Earth for "shore leave" following a war with Mars (which was rendered uninhabitable by the Furon Empires).</plot>

Seeing the furons as a threat to the Soviet Union, the KGB destroy the furon mothership with a nuclear missile.[CR]Destroy All Humans! 2 has a co-op multiplayer mode, so the player can play through the story mode, free roam together and minigames, such as PK Tennis and Duel, with a friend.</plot>

		<plot>Devil Kings is in the same vein as the Dynasty Warriors series. Whereas in Dynasty Warriors, however, Koei focuses on ancient Chinese history, Devil Kings focuses more on feudal Japan, but with a fictional setting with the ability to use modern day weapons such as chain guns and shotguns as well as fighting legendary and fictional characters from the past.[CR]The story takes place as the Devil King, a king possessed by the soul of the Devil, has unleashed an unholy army on the world to bend it to his will as the player must stop him along with many of his minions including his wife Lady Butterfly, his general the Red Minotaur, as well as loyal assassins Scorpio and Venus.[CR]The gameplay is more arcade hack-and-slash style, with the ability of using magic spells to wipe out entire waves of enemies and as mentioned before, the ability to use modern day weapons along with historical weapons such as spears, swords among others. There are six playable characters to use as well, each with their own story told in CG and anime cutscenes as well as two modes of play, Conquest (the main story of the game) and Free Mode (where players can play in any unlocked stage they have completed).</plot>

		<plot>The game is set in the Digimon Data Squad universe, and revolves around the Seven Great Demon Lords. In this game the player will be able to control the four main Savers characters, Marcus Damon, Thomas H. Norstein, Yoshino "Yoshi" Fujieda, and Keenan Crier along with their respective Digimon partners. The graphics for this game are cel-shaded and the battle system is similar to the Battle Terminal (a Japanese-only arcade game). The game is classified as a "special genre", called a "Dramatic/Innovative RPG", which means that the Digimon partners are affected by how you, the player, treat them. The way your Digimon evolves will be similar to Digimon World; the Digimon will be affected by how you take care of it and, depending on that, will digivolve into different types of Digimon. In Digimon World Data Squad, a new type of digivolution method is used, called the Galactica Evolution System: this will determine what Digimon your partner will evolve into. There will also be new, original characters for this game, meaning that these characters are exclusive to Digimon World Data Squad, and will not appear in any other Digimon Data Squad media.</plot>

		<plot>Set after the events of Final Fantasy VII and the Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children movie, Dirge of Cerberus lets players take the role of the mysterious Vincent Valentine.[CR]After a new organization arises from the events known as "Meteorfall", Vincent is called to the surviving town of Kalm by Reeve Tuesti, an old ally who controlled Cait Sith. Vincent has been invited to the town's celebration, but during the festivities, a group of soldiers attacks the town, killing and capturing the people. It is up to Vincent to protect the innocent once more, and find out why these soldiers are also after him.[CR]While set in the world of Final Fantasy VII, Dirge of Cerberus is an action shooter that runs through twelve chapters. The on-screen action can be controlled by the analog controller, or via the Playstation 2's mouse and keyboard accessories, making it more in line with PC-style shooters. Being a character driven shooter, the perspective can be changed from first to third person on the fly to navigate through the multi-level environments.[CR]Several items and characters from the series make their return, as well as the Chaos break limits system, which allows Vincent to take the monstrous forms he changed into from Final Fantasy VII to inflict more damage on the enemy. Taking a nod from its RPG-based parent, the game does allow Vincent to find the usual healing items, materia spells and gil from the Final Fantasy universe, in which he can buy and sell for other new items.[CR]The game also features a weapon customization system, which allows the player to mix and match weapon parts to form more powerful attack items and abilities.</plot>

		<plot>Keith Miyamoto is a reporter who works for an important newspaper in Los Angeles. In 2005, he travels to an island called Capital City, where he has to get a new job. However, on his way from the airport to the city, a terrible earthquake occurs. The train collapses and Keith finds himself abandoned by the rescue team. Now he has to escape the island, try to save the people stranded on it, and discover the true reasons behind the chaos in the city. But that will be anything but easy. The earthquake continues, and any time Keith steps on a half-collapsed bridge, crawls over a pile of rumble, or climbs a narrow path between ruined houses, the Earth can start trembling...[CR]Disaster Report is a combination of pure adventure and survival horror genres. Controls, inventory management, fixed camera angles and relative vulnerability of the protagonist are reminiscent of Alone in the Dark and similar games, while the complete lack of enemies to fight reminds of a classic adventure. There are many ways to preserve Keith from constant dying. You can find items and combine them into new ones (for example, finding a helmet and a lamp will allow you to build a helmet with a flashlight attached to it). Keith will also need to quench his thirst, so you'll have to find water for him. The water taps found in the game also serve as save points.</plot>

		<plot>After a two-year sleep, Prince Laharl awakens to find his father, King Krichevskoy, dead and the Netherworld in the middle of a civil war over who takes the throne. Not willing to give up his rightful place as the next king, Laharl joins with his subordinate Etna and her underlings to fight back.[CR]Disgaea is a tactical role playing game. Battle gameplay takes place on a map divided into a square grid. The player controls a squad of humanoid units and monsters, which each occupy a single square of the grid and do combat with a group of enemies. Depending on the character and attack selected, the player will be able to deal damage to a specific enemy unit or a designated region of the map. Combat ends when all enemy units or all of the player's units are destroyed.[CR]Humanoid characters may lift and throw other units across the map in order to allow allies to move further or force enemies to keep their distance. This even allows the player to capture enemies by throwing them into the base panel; these enemies then become allies, and can be used on subsequent maps. The chance of capturing an enemy in this manner depends on several factors. Failure to capture the enemy will result in the death of all characters inside the base panel, and the enemy will survive.</plot>

		<plot>In order to lift the curse placed upon the inhabitants of Veldime 15 years prior, the protagonist's mother attempts to summon the evil Overilord Zenon so that her son Adell can defeat him and lift the curse. Instead his daughter, Rozalin is summoned, and Adell commits to returning her home to her father, as well as to defeating her father when they find him. [CR]The game is a turn-based strategy RPG in the vein of Final Fantasy Tactics. Classes gain abilities by gaining character levels, and can level up those abilities through use. New items and equipment can be bought or won in battle, and can be powered up up by entering and winning battles inside a given item. Characters can also "gang up" on enemies by performing combos that are activated by positioning other characters near an attacking character. This action only uses the attacking character's turn, leaving the others free to attack again. Clever coordination can have characters attacking quite a few times per turn. New characters can be created (or even reborn as other classes or just more powerful versions of the same class) by petitioning (or even bribing with special items) the Dark Assembly with "Mana" you earn by defeating enemies.</plot>

		<plot>In the Hundred-Acre-Wood, Pooh, Eeyore, Roo, Owl, Rabbit and Tigger are going about their normal activities when Piglet sees a scary Granosorus, which disappears before anyone else can see it. When Piglet tries to warn his friends, they don't believe him. Christopher Robin tells Piglet to overcome his fears, but Piglet thinks that he will never be big and brave enough. As his friends start to fall asleep, Piglet leaves the woods and finds a magical telescope which allows him to jump into the dreams his friends are having during their naps.[CR]In each of the 6 dream "levels", Piglet must help his friends with problems and puzzles. For example, help Pooh find honey or Tigger find his stripes. Each dreamworld is also dangerous with menacing Heffalumps and Woozles, among other scary monsters. Piglet must defeat these monsters with a tactic he knows well - making scary faces. Some monsters aren't frightened enough, though, so use cookies (hidden in the scenery) to buy some scarier ones at the Brave Face Factory. Find and use Christopher Robin's balloon which gives Piglet a morale boost and a burst of speed. Depending upon the scenario, three characters can be controlled: Piglet, Tigger and Winnie the Pooh.</plot>

		<plot>Disney's Chicken Little: Ace in Action is a multiplatform video game based on the finale of the 2005 computer animated film, Chicken Little. The video game was produced as the second in Disney's Chicken Little franchise, which at the time was planned to be expanded into various forms of media including a film sequel. The game was based on the “movie within the movie” finale sequence that concludes the film, and serves as an origin story for the in-universe fictional character "Ace" Chicken. A fourth-wall framing reference was chosen which sees Chicken Little and his friends playing Ace In Action and commenting on it.</plot>

Pooh decide to recall his friends' birthdays - which are the happiest of times.[CR]In Winnie the Pooh's Rumbly Tumbly Adventure, join Pooh and his friends in Hundred Acre Woods on three different types of games:[CR]Birthday Scrapbook Adventure Mode: Pooh flips through his birthday scrapbook and re-live 5 different birthday adventures. Each adventure consists of tasks and problems Pooh has to help solve in order to ensure his friends have the best birthday ever. [CR]Pooh can interact with many different elements around him. For example, if there's a box blocking his way, have Pooh push it away. Gopher is always near by to pop up and give Pooh tips on what he has to to do and how to do it. Pooh will also have to talk to other characters to complete his tasks. For example, in Piglet's Birthday, you will have to find Kenga and borrow her broom for Piglet. Some tasks will require the help of Pooh's friends. For instance, you will have to help Roo collect butterflies for Piglet's birthday by climbing on Eeyore's back and running after the butterflies.[CR]Every now and then Pooh will be confronted by Heffalumps and Woozles. Avoid being touched by them because that will cause you to have to start that segment all over. The only way to get rid of them is by popping a balloon...but don't worry, there is always one near by.[CR]Junior Mode: a place for younger players to interactive with Pooh and his friends in Hundred Acre Woods. See what happens when Pooh approaches a hive or play as Tigger as he spins around.[CR]Multiplayer Mini-Game:Play as Pooh, Roo, Tigger or Piglet in 6 mini-games on your own or with a friend!:[CR]Cookie Maze - Grab as many cookies as possible while avoiding the Heffalumps and Woozles.[CR]Catching the Honey Pot - Try to catch as many honey pots as possible before time runs out.[CR]Find the Cookies - Look around and find the hidden cookies.

		<plot>Cars: Race-O-Rama is a racing game set in the Disney/Pixar Cars universe. It is the third entry in a series of THQ licensed games that include Cars and Cars: Mater-National Championship . The game includes a single-player story mode and an arcade mode. In story mode, you progress through a series of races and mini-games with a series of cutscenes. In arcade mode, you can replay story mode events and compete in 2-player split-screen races.[CR]The plot of Cars: Race-O-Rama centers around Lightning McQueen as he trains students of the Doc Hudson Racing Academy to compete in the Race-O-Rama Circuit. Soon, Lightning discovers that his arch-enemy, Chick Hicks, is training a rival group of racers who don't race by the rules. Lightning must compete against these rival racers in an effort to win the Race-O-Rama trophy.[CR]Story mode uses an open-world format, where you can explore the world and play different events by driving to marked waypoints. There are 7 different main explorable areas including Radiator Springs Stadium, Ornament Valley, Tailfin Pass, Radiator Springs, Santa Carburera, Autovia, and Motoropolis. There are also 3 mini-games based on the Disney/Pixar animated short series "Cars Toons" that center around the character Mater. These include "Mater the Greater", "El Materdor", and "Tokyo Mater".[CR]While racing, there is a boost meter that slowly fills over time. Using the boost will give you a quick speed increase. There is also a new drifting mechanic that allows you to take tighter turns and fill the boost meter more rapidly. You can also jump in most races to avoid obstacles and other racers.</plot>

		<plot>Wall-E is based off of the 2008 Disney/Pixar movie of the same name. The cutscenes closely follow the movie, with added scenes and dialogue added to give more to the game. The gameplay is a basic platformer with a bit of strategy involved, using Wall-E to navigate areas and pick things up to use, players must also figure out ways to reach more out of the reach areas due to Wall-E's limited jump capacity. There are also racing stages designed for the robot, EVE, where the player flies through constricted areas, avoiding fall obstacles.</plot>

		<plot>In Dog's Life you play Jake the puppy, as he explores the USA in an attempt to foil a fiendish plot. Miss Peaches doesn't like dogs, and sees them as a way of making money, by dog-napping Daisy the pedigree dog.[CR]The dog elements are closely integrated into the game - smells are indicated by lines of coloured smoke, emphasising a dog's acute sense of smell. Locating footprints is also done via this Smellovision mode. Tricks can be learnt, and used to win treats from humans.[CR]Jake must explore vast environments and interact with 15 breeds of dog. The aim is to get them onto his side, which is usually done by either having more bones than them, or winning a subgame against them. These are also dog-based - in one you must dig up bones, while another has you 'marking territory' to annex a full screen.</plot>

Under the guidance of Aura, The World, the most popular massively multiplayer online role-playing game at the time, flourishes and the events of .hack//Legend of the Twilight occur during this four-year period</plot>

		<plot>The second release in a series of three, .hack//G.U.: Vol. 2 -- Reminisce takes place in a fictional MMO environment called The World. As in previous releases of .hack, The World features elements of online gaming without the actual connection. Gamers interact with people they might find in a real MMO, take on quests, and adventure across a large environment as they increase their level. [CR]In this version of The World, gamers find the once-utopian landscape is now a player killer's (PKers) heaven. A bug in the game is blocking the log-off ability to all fictional gamers; effectively locking them into The World. Now, bands of PKers prey on every character in their path hoping that the slaughter knocks them out of the game and back into real life. [CR]Gamers take the role of Haseo, a killer of players who is stuck in the game. Haseo must work his way through The World by interacting with other character, defeating enemies in dungeon sprawls, and by completing assigned objectives. Navigation through the game requires the use of Warp points located around the map.</plot>

		<plot>It is 2017 and the dangers found in .hack//G.U.: Vol. 3 Redemption are filtering out of the game. The evil entity terrorizing players in "The World" is free and wreaking havoc in real-life. Players once again take the role of Haseo, a young adventurer who is the only hope for restoring peace in "The World." [CR]Gamers lead Haseo through many recognizable environments and into such new root towns as Breg Epona and the Net Slum. The steam bike makes a return and players can now upgrade their bikes and speed through five riding missions. Toward the end of the game, players may access a 100 floor dungeon and work through each level with their most powerful party members. [CR]Haseo has earned a few upgrades via a mysterious hacker who broke into his account and added a new set of powers. These powers, called the "Xth" form, allow Haseo to use a pair of pistols with blades on the barrel. With these weapons Haseo can deal greater damage and perform a "double trigger" attack by invoking a special ability. [CR]The level cap is increased to 150, and gamers can add up to 22 additional avatars to their party. In the heat of battle, if players find themselves at the losing end, they can access the "avatar awakening" power and drain the virus cores from the enemy. Additionally, there are new cards for the "Crimson Versus" game and a new arena battle.</plot>

Some player characters in The World are mysteriously falling comatose - your main character Kite has to investigate the matter, aided by companions he meets on his trip through the virtual world.[CR]Like the first two hack games, this is an action RPG - essentially a dungeon crawler. You can pause at any time during the battle to issue commands (such as using items). In "Outbreak", you and your opponents start at around level 50 and can reach level 70. You can also import a saved game from the previous game, .hack//MUTATION.</plot>

		<plot>After the dragon rider Rynn returns to her home village, she finds it destroyed, and all its inhabitants massacred. Her dragon, Arokh, tells her that he hears a voice that calls them to the city of Surdana. There, they find out that race of three-faced monsters, called Desert Lords, have been terrorizing the human population recently. In order to fight them, the humans need powerful allies. But the gateway to the world of dragons has been sealed, and only a dragon of the Elder Breed can open it. Rynn and Arokh must now venture to the dragon world, restore the bond between humans and dragons, and defeat the Desert Lords.[CR]Drakan: The Ancients' Gates is an action game with RPG elements. The player will take control of both Rynn and Arokh during the course of the game. Arokh's gameplay involves flying to distant lands and dealing with some of the more powerful foes. Rynn's gameplay has more RPG elements, as she can specialize in the arts of melee fighting, archery, or magic, acquiring experience from defeated enemies.</plot>

		<rom name="ps2-redump-usa-chd-part-D/Drakengard (USA).chd" size="3558673179"/>
		<plot>Drakengard follows the story of a kingdomless prince named Caim who fights for the Union against the Empire. Under the Union's protection are the Hierarchs and the Goddess, currently Caim's sister Furiae, who is a human manifestation of one of the four seals that protect the world from being broken. As the game begins, Cain is fatally wounded in a battle with the Empire. Encountering a captured Red Dragon who is also near death, Caim makes a fateful choice. In exchange for both their lives, the Red Dragon and Caim will enter a pact. This pact will forever chain their lives to one another and link their souls, at the cost of something irreplaceable. Recharged with the fires of a Dragon, Caim's vengeance burns over the enemy...[CR]The player controls Caim on his quest. The game is separated into three distinct modes: Aerial combat, Ground combat and Event Combat. In Aerial Combat, Caim rides dragonback against a variety of airborne foes breathing fireballs (strong single shots and weaker multiple lock-on shots). The Dragon is agile and is able to evade incoming threats, turning around completely in a moment. In Ground combat, the game is shown in 3rd person though usually large, open areas. Controlling Caim, his primary ability is the use of a variety of weapons found on the battlefield. These are leveled up through continued usage, and specifically through the killing of individual enemies. Though magic (determined by weapon choice), timed attacks and evasion, Caim breaks through enemy armies. Characters recruited as allies by Caim can also be summoned during battles, steadily losing health until control is returned to Caim. In ground combat, Caim may also call forth his Dragon to ride and strafe enemies from the air. The Dragon's movements are generally the same as in aerial combat but more limited and less agile. Event combat is similar to Ground combat, but shown isometrically, restricted to a single weapon and without the aid of a dragon. It is used mainly to tell story sequences.[CR]Levels that have been visited before might become "Expedition Missions" which are optional and contain new objectives, enemies and weapons. Additionally, any level previously played in the storyline may be revisited at any time. Depending on Caim's choices (and prerequisites for those choices), there are five different endings to Drakengard.</plot>

Players initially control Po, who differs from the movie in that he possesses a basic level of martial arts skill from the beginning, enabling him to participate in battle. In addition to fighting and jumping challenges, maintaining balance is another important element of the game, such as Po crossing tightropes, staying on moving platforms, and steering a boat through a dangerous river. Over the course of the game's narrative, the player improves Po's skill by adding various new fighting techniques and special moves, although in some parts of the game, the player will have to complete the tasks as another character.</plot>

		<plot>Monsters vs. Aliens is based on the animated movie of the same name. During the course of the game the player takes control over three characters from the movie which all feature different gameplay elements. Missing Link, a mix between fish and human, has to survive levels which are similar to most licensed games from animated movies: a 3rd person platformer. [CR]The sections with B.o.B., a slime monster, are more puzzle oriented. He can swallow enemies or items and use them to spit on other enemies. These are also used to press switches and as safety procedure when crossing bars - if B.o.B. had nothing solid in him he would just slip through them. With B.o.B. the player also has to solve mazes and shooting sequences. The last character is Gigantika, a 15 meters high woman. She uses trucks as inline skates and has to avoid obstacles by jumping or mastering quick time events (pressing a displayed button in a limited time).[CR]In co-op mode the second player takes the role of a Dr. Cockroach and supports the main player with appropriate actions, e.g. shooting. The player can unlock a lot of bonus material, e.g. concept art, deleted scenes (in this case: levels) or audio commentaries.</plot>

		<plot>Mashed is an action-packed top-down arcade-racer. On 13 tracks (which must be played free in single-player first) you need all your driving skills to survive and make it to the finish as the 1st with one of the four different cars available (from slow ones to really fast ones).[CR]The heart of the single-player mode (besides the quick battle against the AI) are the bronze, silver and gold challenges for every track you need to complete to play free the next track. Each challenge is one of the seven (eight in multiplayer) game modes available in Mashed. From normal race-events (just be the 1st) over battles where you need to kill all your enemies before they do to the ultimate survival mode where everyone doesn't really like you.[CR]To make things much easier there are nine different power-ups and weapons scattered on the tracks which you can pick up. From simple oil slicks over mines to deadly mortars there's everything you need to kick the enemy drivers out of the race. Of course they can also choose from the equipment. As you can only survive a few hits you need to make sure they can't use them on you. And to make it even worse there are many small passages (or the track is just one small passage...) with nothing on one or both sides of the track in which you or your enemy can fall very deep.</plot>

		<plot>Set in the year 2015, Drome Racers is a combination of racing gameplay with the Lego license, offering vehicles based upon the 2002 Lego construction toys. Career mode puts the player in the role of Max Axel, who is tasked with winning the coveted Drome Championship. To do so, he must work his way through the ranks by completing a number of Multi-Challenge Races; a series of races in which the completion time in one round is carried over to the next. For example, if Max finished three seconds behind in the last race, the leader is awarded a three-second head start in the next. The overall winner is the first to cross the finish line in the final race of the series. Preceding each Multi-Challenge series is a qualifying drag race, where victory is determined by a good start and proper gear-shifting.[CR]Max Axel is aided by other such Team Nitro members as Shicane who handles car upgrades, and Rocket, who gives advice. The winnings can be put toward building a new car or upgrading the existing one. The former allows players to select the wheels, chassis, and body type of the new vehicle, each of which is suited to specific conditions and environments. The latter offers five level upgrades in categories, such as engine, aerodynamics, turbo, armor, and tires. Weapons also play a vital role. The arcade mode presents players with Normal or Time Attack racing through a variety of courses, weather conditions, and routes. The Quick Race option allows for instant action by randomly selecting any pertinent variables, including cars and tracks, for either one or two players.[CR]The GameCube version features several enhancements, including an extra power-up that was not in the other versions and a 2-Player Battle Mode, where the goal is to destroy the other player's car with power-ups (Though there are variants such as keeping a flag the longest without getting hit). The Battle Mode uses a unique car that cannot be used in normal races (a slightly modified version Lego set 4585 Nitro Pulverizer) and takes place in several special arenas loosely based on the game's tracks (Such as the City Arena which is based on the Foundry track).</plot>

		<plot>Dropship is an action game set in the year 2050. Terrorist attacks have increased severely, which is why big nations of the world decided to form the UPF, "United Peace Force", replacing the UN and NATO. It is an anti-terror army, operating world-wide.[CR]But there is another globally operating group: A massively militarised drug syndicate. When an attack on a peace convoy in Columbia is linked to this cartel, the UPF starts investigation. A central base and training camp of the drug cartel is believed to be located somewhere in Libya. The UPF opens up a base in this country and starts looking for the criminals.[CR]The player is a recently recruited soldier and pilot of the UPF. During the campaign, which lasts for 20 rather long missions, he can travel and fight on foot, in tanks and various other ground vehicles, but most of the time he will be piloting a dropship, either of the attack, defender or transport class. Dropships can operate in hover and flight mode, and carry a large amount of weapons and cargo.</plot>

		<plot>Long, long ago, the real world and dream world were one and the same. But because of the dark thoughts in people's minds, the Nightmare was born and threatened to end the world. A brave sage appeared and, by using the Holy Instruments and the Dream Stone, sealed the Nightmare away into the holy land. Peace was restored but the world is now separated into the real world and dream world.[CR]Years later, people forgot what has happened, and only recalled the events as a legend. Many have also heard about the Dream Stone sealed within the Temple of Dreams. Enter our hero, Rumble, a Ruinseeker (a high ranked treasure hunter) who wish to find the Dream Stone. At the same time, in the Dreamworld, a Baku (a weird looking animal that lives in the Dreamworld) who Rumble later names Tumble accidentally drops the box which holds 7 keys to the seal of the Temple. The keys went and hid in different people's dreams. To retrieve them, one must enter the dream and seek out the keys. Tumble can enter the dreams but there are many monsters within dreams and puzzles that he may need help with. Rumble realize he must get the keys in order to find the Dream Stone. Seeing that the two can help meet each other's goals, Rumble and Tumble decides to work together.[CR]In Dual Hearts, Rumble and Tumble will travel around Sonno Island, meeting the people there and seek out those whose dreams holds one of the seven keys. Each dream is different as each person is different, which means that the enemies and puzzles Rumble will encounter will be different in each dream he visits. Within the dreamworld, everything is filled with gold and gems - even the boss is a giant money bag.[CR]Within the dreams, Rumble will be able to use the Holy Instruments (in the form of a spear and sword) to fight enemies there. Rumble can use both weapons at the same time enabling him to do a variety of combo attacks. Tumble will help Rumble by carrying him on his back, enabling him to reach higher planes. He can also perform different attacks like the Breath Attack.[CR]In order to advance, there are a variety of puzzles for our heroes to solve. For example, in one puzzle, you will be presented with movable blocks, several switches and a closed door. You must figure out which switch will open the door and move the block on the switch. If you run into any problems, you can always talk to Tumble or the Dream Sheep for hints and help.</plot>

		<plot>The sequel to Dynasty Tactics gives the player more tactics to choose from, and introduces some new characters and features.[CR]Like in the first game, the player assumes the role of 3 important leaders in ancient China: Cao Cao, Liu Bei and Sun Ce. A new choice is the warrior Lu Bu. The characters have their own, unique story paths, which are affected by choices and outcomes occurring during the chapters the game is divided into. The player organizes and moves his officers and armies over the map while engaging others, trying to fulfill certain objectives during a turn limit.[CR]For battles, the game switches from the map to a dedicated screen showing the battlefield. The battle system is a bit like chess: the player moves the units around the battlefield in a turn-based fashion, mostly trying to bring them in a position to pull off special tactics. Ideally, this results in effective combos, that may not only defeat enemy units, but also capture the leading officers, which may join the player (there are over 200 in the game).[CR]Morale and terrain need to be taken into consideration as well. Units have different abilities depending on their type and position in the army, Engineers may build useful installments like supply depots for example. Army strategists can use the link command retained from the previous game for pinning down enemy units and helping to rack up higher combos, in addition, they may order chains now. These allow individual officers to perform multiple tactics (provided the conditions are met for each of them), but cost morale.[CR]The game also contains a two player versus mode, which consists of random battles.</plot>

The heart of the game, campaign mode, begins by choosing any of 24 regions and 42 rulers (custom characters can be created). Beginning with a small kingdom, the ultimate goal is the conquering of all others. Each turn, the player is given a choice from 4 different governing options (brought to your attention by your generals) followed by a single decision of action. These actions typically include the invasion or defense of a specific province or the option to aid an allied empire with those same actions.</plot>

		<plot>Set in ancient China, Dynasty Warriors 5: Empires brings the Empire mode to the latest DW game, while the basic hack and slash, button mashing gameplay remains the same.[CR]The Empire mode adds a strategy overlay to the basic game, with a map of 25 areas to conquer. Each turn consists of two parts: empire control, and war making. Your territories bring you tax revenue each turn, which you can spend on various different actions. You can create items and tactics for your generals to use in battle. Recruit generals and troops, fortify your territories, among many other command options. You can wage war on other territories, or may be called upon to defend your own. For each battle you select which generals and lieutenants will fight. There are 4 scenarios to unlock, though they offer little to differentiate each other.[CR]There is two player split-screen co-op, in either of Empire of Free play modes. Next to the soundtrack of the base game, this edition also adds soundtracks from previous titles, including Dynasty Warriors 2, Dynasty Warriors 3 and Dynasty Warriors 4.</plot>

		<plot>Dynasty Warriors 5: Xtreme Legends is a minor expansion to Dynasty Warriors 5. This game was released on November 16, 2005 and is playable only on the PlayStation 2 video game console.[CR]Dynasty Warriors 5: Xtreme Legends does not allow the player to play Musou Mode or Free Mode if the player does not possess the original Dynasty Warriors 5 game disk. New game modes included Destiny Mode, Xtreme Mode, and Legend Mode.[CR]Xtreme Mode is a parallel to Shura Mode in Dynasty Warriors 5 Special, in which the objective of the game is for the human-controlled character to survive as long as possible while collecting gold dropped by enemies to regain health and increase stats temporarily.[CR]In Destiny Mode, the player is first allowed to customize a character. After creating a personalized character, a player will be asked to join the Kingdom of Shu, Wei and Wu. While in this mode, you will be playing as a character with very few attacks (starting off with only 2 fundamental hits) and will be "protected" by a chosen officer near the character. The officer will heal the character continuously when injured during battle, so long as the character is nearby. A unique feature of Destiny Mode is that at times the player is given the option to betray one force, while setting a ruse for another. For example, a player receives a letter from Cao Cao, the King of Wei, in which he asks the player to defect from the Kingdom of Wu to the Kingdom of Wei. If the player defers the offer to switch sides their commander may approach them in the hopes of creating a ruse to destroy the opposing force. If the player chooses to accept the option from their commander they will fight for the other side temporarily. When the time is right their original commander will have them move the opposing commander to a set position which will trigger their ruse and supporting units will ambush the opposing commander to support the player's defection.</plot>

		<plot>Veteran publisher Koei draws more inspiration from Chinese literature's Romance of the Three Kingdoms for its sixth installment of Dynasty Warriors. As with previous titles in the action-oriented series, players choose from a variety of stout heroes and noble warriors before engaging in historically inspired battles featuring hundreds of combatants. While the series has been criticized for its lack of significant changes from release to release, Dynasty Warriors 6 adds a number of enhancements to the well-traveled franchise. Though it lacks the graphical flourishes of the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions, the PS2 edition of Dynasty Warriors 6 offers ten new scenarios, five additional stages, and host of new weapons. The emphasis is still on defeating throngs of enemies with swords, giant hammers, polearms, and other weapons, with lengthy combo chains possible by varying attacks.[CR]As players become more skilled in combat, they can choose from a variety of skills to customize their heroes as they see fit. A new "renbu" system allows characters to earn immediate combat bonuses through dexterous play, but these bonuses are lost once the battle is over. Characters also have the ability to swim across water and scale walls to perform surprise attacks on enemy camps. Another change is the omission of bodyguards, so players must go it alone instead of having a personal entourage. In their place is a faithful steed that can be called upon in a pinch to make hasty retreats or to charge at full gallop into groups. The character's horse will also level up along with characters, improving attributes in speed or power in combat. Featured game types include Musou Mode, a character-specific campaign, Challenge Mode, offering specific goals to complete, and Free, which involves building a character's stats on any unlocked battlefield. Players can also team-up with a friend via split-screen display.</plot>

Players play NBA games with real teams and players, as well as playing street basketball with customizable players. NBA game simulations feature commentary from Bill Fitzgerald and Tom Tolbert, and pregame shows by Kevin Frazier. The game features online multiplayer for the first time in the NBA 2K series.[CR]Several gameplay improvements and additions were made. The passing game for example has been rebuilt; instead of one type of basic pass, the player can freely choose from basic, behind the back, between the legs, or alley-oop passes. The previous dribbling system has been replaced by IsoMotion, a system that features many animations, allows the player to perform hesitations, in-and-outs, or ankle breakers, and emphasizes quick timing and reflexes.[CR]24/7 mode is one of the game's main features. The player creates their basketball player, customizing the physical appearance (facial features, hair, skin colour, accessories, jersey, etc.), and journeys across the United States, competing against other basketball players, including NBA stars, in tournaments or street pickup games. The player completes different challenges in different types of events against their opponent(s). For example, the player's goal in one event could be to get five dunks in a one-on-one game, while in another, the player may be tasked with completing a five-on-five event without getting a shot blocked. The player upgrades their basketball player's abilities and attributes, thus getting better, unlocks different animations, and equips different accessories, as they complete events. The player also improves their "rank", which in turn, unlocks more events or items, and improves the player's reputation, allowing the player to play with certain players and take on bosses.[CR]In addition to the 24/7 mode, online multiplayer, and local multiplayer game modes, the game features other modes, such as quick play. The player may play playoff games, play through a full NBA regular season, practice in an empty arena, play street basketball games, which are considerably different to regular NBA games, as well as manage a team in the franchise mode, where players can fire coaches and other personnel, trade players, and play through the NBA.</plot>

		<plot>ESPN NFL 2K5 has a ton of new features for the new season.[CR]To start off, the ESPN presentation has been greatly expanded. Chris Berman, who did voiceover for the half-time show in 2K4, returns for this season. Instead of just voice, there is a virtual Chris Berman, who does an introduction to each game, a half-time report, and a post-game show. To illiustrate certain points, he uses replays from each game. [CR]One new feature is the V.I.P. system, which keeps track of how you play the game. If you pass 80% of the time, and run 20% of the time, your V.I.P. profile will reflect this. At a later time, you can play against your V.I.P., and the AI will play as if it were you.[CR]ESPN celebrates it's 25th anniversary this year, and as such, a special 25th Anniversary Mode has been added. This mode allows you to play moments from classic football games, including The Heidi Bowl and The Immaculate Reception.[CR]The Crib has an overhaul this year. Instead of earning specific items by completing tasks, you earn points, which you can use to buy items of your choice. New to the Crib is a dart board, as well as a phone, which you will use to answer calls from celebrities. You may get a call from Steve-O, Carmen Electra, Jamie Kennedy, David Arquette or Funkmaster Flex, challenging you to a game.[CR]Franchise mode also gets an overhaul. New to 2005 is the ability to schedule weekly preps for your team. You can choose to have players work out, play practice games, watch tapes, all in an effort to gear your team up for the next game.</plot>

		<plot>ESPN NHL 2K5 is the second hockey game using Sega's partnership with the worldwide leader in sports, ESPN.[CR]As with any sports game, you get the standard game modes. 2K5 has a vastly improved Franchise mode over last year's game. In addition to the e-mail system that was introduced, you have the ability to hire several coaches. You can choose a head coach, offensive coach, defense coach, scouting coach, a goaltending coach and more. When it comes time to hire and fire players, you use actual money, and not points to negotiate contracts.[CR]There are a few special game modes as well. You have access to the skills mode, which was also found in last year's game. You can choose accuracy shooting, puck control, hardest shot, fastest skater, and a few more. There is also a Party Mode, which is set up for one to four players (you and friends or you and the computer), which pits you in fast action games. An example is a free-for-all, where you have to get the puck and score it in the net while the constantly moving cinder wall, which blocks the net, is down.</plot>

		<plot>Enthusia Professional Racing is a driving simulation that features hundreds of licensed vehicles from dozens of various manufacturers. The cars vary in type, class, and time periods, so you can find some old timers as well as family cars and test them on the given tracks, race against another player in split-screen mode, or play the Enthusia Life mode and fill in your garage with as many cars as you can hold, or try the Driving Revolution to tune up your driving skills.[CR]You can drive in first-person view or looking at the car from the typical back third-person view, with some extras you can turn on, such as VGS (Visual Gravity System) which provides detailed information about car handling and tire traction. The cars in this game are true to their physics (you can see a movie comparison of real car and Enthusia ingame car if you wait a little while on main menu), more than 300 different physics parameters were reproduced for every car.</plot>

		<plot>In this game, the player controls Mouse, a silent musician who travels with his talking guitar Pattimo. One day Mouse is invited to play at a royal wedding on an island called Pandule. But soon he discovers that the groom Xelpherpolis has put an awful time-looping spell on the island, and intends to destroy this way the entire population. Mouse has to stop the villain and, most importantly, recruit other people to help him break the spell.[CR]Ephemeral Fantasia is a Japanese-style role-playing game with turn-based combat. Several characters can be recruited to the party. The game's stand-out feature is the time-looping system, which is somewhat similar to the one implemented in The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. The game has an internal clock, and the first five days repeat themselves until Mouse finds a way to stop it. Certain events occur only if Mouse travels to a specific location at a specific time.</plot>

		<plot>Guybrush Threepwood has finally defeated the zombie pirate LeChuck, and married his sweetheart Elaine Marley. The happy couple is returning home from an exciting honeymoon. But as they arrive on Melee Island, they notice some very strange changes. A mysterious stranger who calls himself Charles L. Charles is organizing a campaign to become the next governor. The Australian businessman Ozzie Mandrill is turning the Caribbean into an attraction for tourists. And on top of that, Elaine's mansion is being demolished! Naturally, it's up to our hero to revert the things back to normal, even if that means traveling to exotic islands and solving puzzles on the way.[CR]Escape From Monkey Island is a direct sequel to The Curse of Monkey island, and is the fourth game in the Monkey Island series. The gameplay relies mainly on inventory-based puzzles and branching dialogues, just like in the previous installments. The interface is similar to that of Grim Fandango: mouse is not used, and the interaction is done via context-sensitive commands that appear on the screen whenever you navigate Guybrush close to an object. The game utilizes pre-rendered backgrounds and 3D character models.</plot>

The world featured many places familiar to fans of the original and most of the differences were explained in the lore of EverQuest.[CR]The gameplay focused on character advancement, environment combat, quests, exploration, grouping, and socializing. It also contained a simple dueling system for 1 v. 1 player action (not counting player pets), which suffered much criticism and was involved in many item duping glitches.[CR]There were fifteen playable classes, and ten races.[CR]Classes included Cleric, Druid, Shaman, Enchanter, Wizard, Alchemist, Necromancer, Magician, Bard, Ranger, Rogue, Monk, Paladin, Shadowknight, and Warrior.[CR]Races consisted of Dwarves, Elves, Dark Elves, Human (Eastern and Western), Gnome, Troll, Ogre, Barbarian, Erudite, and Halfling.</plot>

		<plot>Evergrace is very basic, Japanese action RPG. As usual, player controls a young hero who eventually will save the world from the clutches of evil. The story takes two roads of two different heroes who run around fields killing monsters in real time action a bit like in Zelda games. The hook in this game, or not so much of a hook, but the thing that separates it from most of other RPG is that the characters don't level up. The power of character is measured by his equipment so when you get a better sword, you kinda level up that way. The weapons and equipment are also customizable so if you like playing with your tools, this is the game for you. This was the first RPG to appear on PS2 in Europe.</plot>

		<plot>Evolution Skateboarding is a 2002 skateboarding video game released by Konami for the PlayStation 2 and GameCube. It consists of several popular skateboarders, such as Rick McCrank, Arto Saari, Kerry Getz, and Danny Way. There is also a create-a-skater feature and an unlockable character for every skater the player completes the game as. There are also sets of level specific songs such as the metal-remix of the Metal Gear Solid theme and a Castlevania theme after unlocking the Vampire Hunter. Levels are unlocked by beating a certain amount of objectives in a current level, such as collecting items like boots and other objects, performing tricks in certain areas of a level, and the occasional grinding a certain amount of meters. The Evolution Skateboarding engine was used in the bonus skateboarding mode included in the PlayStation 2 version of Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance.</plot>

		<plot>Brave PS2 gamers face off against hordes of viciously mutated creatures in this fast-paced shooter adventure from Deep Space and Sony. Extermination puts the player in the role of a highly-trained Marine Special Forces operative, Dennis Riley, who has orders to investigate a distress signal coming from a top secret base located in the empty frozen wastelands of Antarctica. Armed with a Special Purpose Rifle that can be upgraded with various scope, ammunition, and shotgun enhancements, the hero arrives to find that a mysterious plague has broken out in the facility and caused all life forms to mutate into deadly and evil creatures. Players must eliminate the threat of the virus and the hostile creatures it has created, all without becoming infected.[CR]The game is played from a third-person perspective, and all of the environments are rendered in real-time, allowing the camera to cinematically swoop around for the best view possible. The camera can also be configured into a manual first-person view aim, allowing for extremely precise shooting as well as a guide to the general layout of the environment.[CR]Extermination for the PlayStation 2 derives its roots and plays similarly to the survival horror game Resident Evil, but in a new twist to the genre, players will have to worry about becoming infected with the virus that has swept through the Fort Stewart installation. The infection level is measured by a percentage, and once that percentage reaches 100 percent, a parasite begins to spread throughout your body. Your health is dramatically reduced and certain elements (such as water) decrease your health percentage greatly. If you do not get a special treatment known as the MTS and find a medical bed in the installation, the infection takes over and turns you into a zombie-like mutant.</plot>

		<plot>EyeToy: AntiGrav is the first full-fledged game for the PS2 Eyetoy camera peripheral. Using a head-and-hands body recognition system, the onscreen character responds to the control of the player's body movements. Take one of 8 hoverboarders through 5 tracks ranging from a run-down Chinese wharf to an intense professional hoverboarding arena. And while it is an "extreme" sports boarding game, the gameplay contains flavors of SSX, DDR, Stun Runner, a little Return of the Jedi, and a lot of other influences. Of course, it is the uniqueness of the controls that drives the design of the game, the experience of the game, and ultimately whether or not the player enjoys it.</plot>

Without it, the player's image on the screen is too large to play this game properly. It is held in a foam insert in the standard memory card holder in the disc case. The lens attachment is not sold separately, so if it is broken or lost then the only recourse is to repurchase the entire game.[CR]The game's sequel is titled EyeToy: Kinetic Combat.</plot>

The main objective of the game is to guard a room from an intruder. Unique features include new face recognition technology, new video messaging, and interactive missions. If an intruder is caught, the next time the player returns to the room they can watch the recorded video of who came in. The idea for EyeToy: Operation Spy came from the game EyeToy: Play 2 which also had similar security features.</plot>

The level of detail on the visuals looks to be second to none, with each circuit boasting its own real-life structures, bumps in the track, motion-captured pit crews, animated grid girls, and planes and helicopters in the sky above.[CR]The cars in the game feature realistic driving physics and damage models that take into account the materials that the various components are made of. Fortunately, players have access to the same kind of data telemetry that real drivers and their teams do, so it should be possible to devise car setups that are appropriate for each circuit and so minimize the chances of crashing.</plot>

A new collision detection system with 360 degree coverage and hundreds of new collision animations enable players to behave according to their physical attributes. Player speed, direction and strength now determine everything from the severity of the collision to the outcome of possession. Plus, contact occurs with shoulders, arms and legs. Stronger players possess the strength to knock down smaller players or use their body or arms to win challenges. Player strength and momentum also determine outcomes in challenges through the new shielding system, with dozens of new outcomes created. Plus, players can now shield the ball by pushing off the defender to create space - at the risk of being called for a foul - just like real life. The increased control shielding the ball adds another strategic element to matches, enabling you to slow the game's pace as needed.</plot>

		<plot>FIFA Football 2002 (known as FIFA Soccer 2002: Major League Soccer in North America, and FIFA 2002: Road to FIFA World Cup in Japan), commonly known as FIFA 2002, is a football video game released in 2001, produced by Electronic Arts and released by EA Sports. FIFA 2002 is the ninth game in the FIFA series.[CR]Power bars for passes were introduced, and dribbling reduced in order to attain a higher challenge level. The power bar can also be customised to suit the gamer's preference. The game also includes club emblems for many more European clubs as well as for major Dutch clubs such as PSV, AFC Ajax and Feyenoord, although there was no Dutch league of any kind (they were under the "Rest of World" header). This game also features, for the first time, the Swiss Super League, at the cost of excluding the Greek League. A card reward system licensed from Panini was also introduced where, after winning a particular competition, a star player card is unlocked. There is also a bonus game with the nations that had automatically qualified for the 2002 World Cup (France, Japan and South Korea), in which the player tries to improve the FIFA ranking of their chosen team by participating in international friendlies.[CR]Many of the international teams in the game are not licensed (some of them down to the players' names like the Netherlands), as well as smaller countries such as Barbados, who were only given numbers as player names. Also, to date, this was the last FIFA edition (not counting the World Cup versions) to feature the Japanese national team, since Japan Football Association would go on to concede exclusive rights to Konami's Pro Evolution Soccer series.[CR]FIFA Football 2002 ran for 10 years as the last FIFA to have only one person as the cover star, before Lionel Messi appeared alone on FIFA 13.</plot>

The passing game has been improved as to allow better passing by kicking directly to a teammate, passing to nowhere in particular, or open passing to allow anybody to take it.[CR]FIFA 2003 includes all FIFA clubs, leagues, and players.</plot>

		<plot>FIFA Football 2004, also known as FIFA Soccer 2004 in North America, is a football video game developed by EA Canada and published by Electronic Arts. It was released in October 2003 with the tagline "Create Brilliance".[CR]FIFA Football 2004 is the eleventh game in the FIFA series and the eighth to be in 3D. While not adding much to the engine used in FIFA Football 2003, the biggest new inclusions were secondary divisions, which allow the player to take lower ranked teams to promotion attempts. Gameplay has a new feature dubbed "Off the ball", which allows the control of two players at the same time for greater tactical play. Another key feature was Football Fusion, which allows owners of both FIFA 2004 and Total Club Manager 2004 to play games from the management sim in FIFA. The title sequence was filmed in St James' Park, home of Newcastle United, with the opening song being Kings of Leon's European hit "Red Morning Light".[CR]The cover features Alessandro Del Piero of Juventus, Thierry Henry of Arsenal, and Ronaldinho in a Brazil kit.</plot>

It's also possible to create all kinds of competitions. The Career mode was also extended, allowing now up to 15 seasons, and giving the player the chance to turn the tide of a simulated match anytime. This mode is a "light" managerial mode, where the player not only plays, but also signs new players and increase the clubs abilities in trainers, medical staff and other club staff).</plot>

When Timmy tries to make a wish, his fairy godparents Cosmo and Wanda tell him that it's against "Da Rules". Outraged, Timmy wishes he didn't have to follow the rules. As a result, Cosmo destroys the book; when Vicky arrives, she gains possession of Da Rules. She wishes that Timmy was still sleeping, and since she has possession of a fairy item, her wish is granted. Timmy, Cosmo and Wanda go to Fairy Court, and are accused of destroying Da Rules. Jorgen gives the three of them 49½ hours to find the missing pages of Da Rules. Timmy must navigate through ten levels and find the pages before Vicky's wishing goes too far. By the end of the game, everything is back to normal and Da Rules has all of its pages back.[CR]The PC version features a different plot. In this version, Juandissimo Magnifico tricks Timmy into wishing the book destroyed so that Cosmo and Wanda will get in trouble for it. It also notably features an appearance by Vicky and Tootie's mother (at Timmy's age, as the level featuring her is set in the past), named Nicky. Here, she is shown behaving a lot like Tootie, and Timmy initially mistakes her for Tootie when he first sees her, although the in-game graphics depict her as resembling a young Vicky.[CR]In the Game Boy Advance version, Anti-Cosmo arrives to steal the book, and Vicky is defeated at the very end to restore peace.</plot>

		<plot>A simulation of the TV game show of the same name. Two families will compete against each other to choose the most common answers to questions such as "Things a jockey needs", or "Clothes that don't go on hangers". More than 1000 questions are included.[CR]The 2006 edition has both standard and quick games. The standard game contains 5 rounds. In rounds 1-4, two people are selected, one from each team, who compete to buzz in a common answer to the question on the board. The team that wins control then has to figure out the other common answers, earning a strike for any answers that are not common. If any common answers remain after that team's third strike, the other team has a chance to steal all the points for that round by guessing an unrevealed answer. In rounds 3 and 4, the stakes are higher. In round 5, two people from the winning team work together to find common answers to questions before time runs out. The quick game has just one family, who has to guess the common answers to a question. Finding all answers earns bonus points.[CR]The standard game can be played against the computer, another player on the same computer, or over the Internet. Answer questions by typing them out or using the on-screen keyboard; the computer will recognize word variations and some misspellings. A family editor is included, which lets you edit body type and clothing. By playing the game, new clothing options and studios will be unlocked.</plot>

		<plot>This game is a licensee of the 2005 movie "Fantastic 4". Unlike many licensed titles, this third-person action game in the vein of the Onimusha or Devil May Cry series only takes the base of its plot from the actual movie, then liberally changes it to make for better gameplay.[CR]Generally, the game brings in more content from the comic books than the movie, particularly considering the villains that appear. While the movie pretty much only concerned itself with Victor von Doom aka "Doctor Doom" as its supervillain of choice, the game brings in various characters from the comic books as well - the Mole Man, the Puppet Master, or Diablo, to name a few.[CR]The gameplay usually consists of walking the heroic title characters around a level and beating up the various enemies that cross their path. There are mission objectives, but usually the only way to achieve them leads through the enemies and just as usually the only way to fail them is to be overwhelmed by the Bad Guys. Beating up enemies yields points, which can be used to upgrade characters with new special moves or unlock various bonus materials.[CR]To spice it all up, developer Seven Studios have also thrown in a co-op mode that allows for playing the normal single-player mission in a tag team with a second player.</plot>

		<plot>Fight Club is based on David Fincher's film adaption of Chuck Palahniuk's novel of the same name. Fed up with consumerist American culture, a fight club is founded as a new type of therapy through bare-knuckle fighting. The game focuses on the fights and uses many characters and environments from the original story. You can create a new fighter or clone one of the generated characters. There are three general fighting styles to choose from: grappling, kung fu or brawling. The moves range from basic punches to devastating moves with broken bones, ripped clothes and real-time facial deformation. After each successful fight, you earn Character Development Points (CDP's) which can be used to upgrade or heal your character.[CR]Aside from the regular arcade, survival and training mode, there is a story mode in which you need to work your way up as a rookie to become a key player in Project Mayhem in a storyline very loosely based on the original plot. Both the PS2 and Xbox version have an online multiplayer mode as well.</plot>

The "Total Boxer Control", which lets you throw punches by making certain movements with the analog stick, has been improved. There are also many ways to customize the appearance of your character, up to the shaping of the cranium and ears.[CR]The soundtrack consists of a dozen contemporary (but unfortunately edited) hip-hop tracks.</plot>

		<plot>The game's story follows the character Yuna from Final Fantasy X as she seeks to resolve political conflicts in the fictional world of Spira before it leads to war.[CR]The story begins as Yuna, Rikku and Paine recover Yuna's stolen Garment Grid from the Leblanc Syndicate in the first of several encounters in which they vie for spheres. The game is punctuated by a narration of Yuna addressing Tidus, as though she is recounting the events of the game to him as they occur in a style reminiscent of Tidus' own narration in Final Fantasy X. Although Yuna's quest is to find clues that may lead her to Tidus, much of the storyline of the game follows the clash of the factions that have established themselves in the time since the coming of the Eternal Calm in Final Fantasy X, and the uncovering of hidden legacies from Spira's ancient history. A significant portion of the game's events are unnecessary for the completion of the main storyline, but much of the depth of the story—including characterization and background details—are featured in the optional content, which generally follows how each part of Spira is healing in the time since the passing of Sin.</plot>

		<plot>Final Fantasy XI, also known as Final Fantasy XI Online, is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game, the first to offer cross-platform play between PlayStation 2 and personal computer. It was also the Xbox 360's first MMORPG. All versions of the game require a monthly subscription to play.[CR]The setting of Final Fantasy XI is the world of Vana'diel, a rich world with diverse climates, ranging from northern glaciers and southern deserts, to ethereal realms and sky landmasses.[CR]Ancient lore states that Vana'diel was created as a playground for the Gods and their children, who themselves were spawned from an enormous and sentient Crystal. The creation lore's sentient Crystal, Gods, Children, and the truths behind them feature as major plot points in several Final Fantasy XI expansion packs.[CR]The events of the game are set 20 years after the Crystal War, a devastating war where the Middle Land nations of Bastok, San d'Oria and Windurst fought and defeated the Shadow Lord and his army of Beastmen. Players deal with the aftermath of this conflict in the original story, and may travel back in time to aid in the war effort with the expansion pack Wings of the Goddess. Several parallel worlds are available, such as Dynamis and Abyssea, in which the beastmen won the Crystal War and conquered the land.</plot>

		<plot>Firefighter F.D.18 is an action game created and produced by Konami Computer Entertainment and released in March 2004 for the PlayStation 2.[CR]The game revolves around Dean McGregor, a highly skilled firefighter. The plot is supposedly taken from the film Backdraft, and this is backed by the fact that many similarities can be found, such as the locations of the fires, the company number, and the cinematic sequences.[CR]In this game, players become firefighters. Their goal is to clear areas where fire has broken out and rescue civilians and fight fire "bosses" at the end. Players have an axe, a fire hose, and a fire extinguisher to break down doors and put out fires as they rescue survivors. Stages are timed. Obstacles, such as falling beams, and chemicals, hinder progress and must be cleared before the player can progress further</plot>

		<plot>A pinball game with multiple twists. Flipnic isn't your basic pinball game, it's a psychedelic trip through fantastic land of pinball. The game features multiple tables in which the player must complete a given set of tasks before she can proceed to the next level. Each of the "tables" consists of many smaller playing areas and every one has some gimmick in them. For example, one must first freeze the waterfall and then destroy the ice and climb a mountain behind it. All this using only the paddles and the ball.</plot>

		<plot>A prequel to 2000's Evergrace, Forever Kingdom chronicles the adventures of Darius and his companions Ruyan and Faeana. An evil wizard named Darsul has cursed the three adventurers, causing their souls to become entangled as one. Only by exploring an ancient and mysterious land will they be able to free themselves.[CR]Unlike the first title, where players switched back and forth between two different adventurers, this incarnation follows all three characters. While only one character can be controlled at any given time, all share the same life bar referred to as a Soul Gage. Each character also has distinct physical and magical attacks to use on enemies.[CR]Gathering items and weapons plays an integral role in character development, as the leveling-up system found in traditional RPGs has been eliminated. Instead, a character's attributes are influenced by his or her equipment. Not only do changes made to an outfit alter ability in battle, but they affect the way other characters perceive players as well. [CR]Depending on how NPCs perceive them, players may receive cheaper items or be given information they would not otherwise be privy to. A character's weapons, clothes, and items are shown in real time, thus any changes made will instantly alter his or her outward appearance.</plot>

The second part of the game is a freestyle competition, where you perform tricks to score points, and attempt to rack up the biggest total.[CR]The racing game, or "Freekstyle" mode, combines racing and tricks. You will race around a circuit track, and attempt to perform tricks at the big jumps you encounter along the way. Performing tricks fills your boost meter, which then gives you a speed boost you can use at your discretion. If you perform enough tricks, eventually you can break into "freakout" mode, where you can travel at ludicrous speed.[CR]Freekstyle features the voices and likeness of several real-life motocross stars.</plot>

		<plot>In the year 2096, the Wanzer ("Walking Tanks" mecha) form the backbone of many military forces. The European Community is enjoying a period of relative peace when it is surprised by sudden attacks on German bases from a mysterious force. To investigate, it is decided to send the EC Armor Tactics Research Corps, also known as "Durandal". Inside the Durandal, a young new recruit, Elsa soon finds herself caught in an international plot. Meanwhile, the nation of Venezuela, is attempting to secede from the Unified Continental States (U.C.S.). UCS Forces are sent in to restore order and dispose of Governor Diaz. During a routine patrol, Sgt. Darril and his patrol witness a cargo plane being shot down. Heading to investigate, they soon discover it was a plane carrying part of Diaz's gold. For demoralized UCS soldiers like Darril, this smells like opportunity...[CR]Front Mission 4 is a turn based strategy game where the plot switches between two different theaters of operation: Elsa and Darril. Controlling the wanzer forces of either character, the story progresses simultaneously. Most battles take place on an overhead map divided into a Player phase and an Enemy phase. Typically a wanzer can move once and use his remaining Action Points (AP) to fire on the enemy or use an ability. Success in battle earns Experience Points, which are traded in for new abilities, such as Rapid Fire or Evasion bonuses. Each character has a set limit of Skill slots, which are filled up differently by abilities. While each character starts with a preference in skills, there is no limitation on what any pilot can learn. Money, found during on the map (along with items) or earned after a successful battle, can be used to upgrade wanzers and purchase new weapons.</plot>

		<plot>Fugitive Hunter: War on Terror (released as America's 10 Most Wanted in Europe), is a first-person shooter game for the PlayStation 2 and PC. Developed by Black Ops Entertainment and released in 2004, it was critically panned due to its dated graphics and lackluster fighting-game style boss battles. The European and American versions differentiate slightly in level music and terrorist names with Saddam Hussein only being present in the European version.[CR]According to an unlockable documentary snippet included in-game, development began before the September 11th terrorist attacks. In the wake of the attacks and as development continued, Osama Bin Laden would become a more prominent character in the game, ultimately serving as the primary antagonist.</plot>

		<plot>In Full Spectrum Warrior, you take on the role of commander of two squads of the United States military, Alpha and Bravo, as you guide them in the fictional country of Zekistan on a mission to capture or kill the terrorist Al Afad.[CR]In the game, you don't directly control your troops. You don't take aim at a target and shoot, and you don't circle-strafe around enemies. Instead, you tell your squad what to do, and they'll do it. It's like a real-time strategy game. You can tell your two squads to do numerous things, such as hide behind a wall, take cover behind a car, lob a grenade, fire off a rocket, or attack a target. You will need to utilize both squads to be successful. For example, you can have Alpha squad hide behind a car and lay down covering fire at a target that you can't directly kill, giving Bravo squad cover so they may cross open terrain, and get into a position where they will be able to kill the enemy.[CR]The game takes place in one locations, a Middle Eastern country, that's split up into several areas. You'll have to make your way through parks, an airport, city streets, and even some buildings. Throughout the country are many terrorists, all of whom are trying to kill you. You have four members on each squad; the Team Leader, Automatic Rifleman, Grenadier and Rifleman. Each plays a unique role.[CR]Full Spectrum Warrior supports Xbox Live, where two players can play through the single player campaign. Instead of controlling both squads, one player controls Alpha while the other controls Bravo.</plot>

		<plot>An International Hardhitters Tournament is underway in West Sussex, with Ben Clifford coming close to achieving the ultimate crown on a number of occasions, notably when Edgar played Duncan in the quarter finals. Recently however the spoils have been taken by James 'super serve' Southwood through primarily playing with Laval (GER). Critics have attacked his serve and volley game as one dimensional. But he has proved himself time after time in a game of such skill and patience.</plot>

In Adventure mode the player creates an identity and starts in the Hard Rock Casino. They are free to play any game but must complete a set of goals before they can unlock the next casino. While playing at the Hard Rock they may also be asked to undertake challenges, or side tasks, in which they can earn extra money. In one such challenge a customer complains that a slot machine is broken because it does not pay out so the manager offers $100 as a reward for getting a winning line on that machines maximum bet.[CR]Quick play allows the player access to all the games in the unlocked casinos playing as a randomly selected game character. Here there are no goals or challenges.Poker Tournaments gives the player instant access to the same poker tournaments that are available in both Adventure and Quick play modes however the Adventure mode has a greater variety of table limits. [CR]There are four different casinos in which to play, each with its own games, house rules and table limits. Players start with a modest amount of money, $1000, in the Hard Rock. The object is, naturally, to win lots more and earn a high enough reputation to be able to play in invitation-only tournaments and high stakes games. The major goal is to become the "Hard Rock High Roller".</plot>

		<plot>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a 2005 video game based on the film Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. The movie is based on J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the fourth novel in the Harry Potter series.[CR]The game follows the three main characters of the film — namely Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley — and there is an entirely new spell-casting system that allows for collaborative spells. The characters themselves more closely resemble their film counterparts than in previous games. It also has higher-quality graphics than the previous Harry Potter video games. However, the game play in the fourth video game is much more action-oriented, which is a change from the previous games.[CR]In addition, players can play the game with friends, and can combine their magic and spells to make them more powerful. Players can also capture moving beans using Accio and increase their power with collectors, creature, and character, cards.[CR]There is no RPG iteration of the game, unlike with previous titles. In addition, it was pointed out that unlike the previous installments, there was not much room to "run around" such as in the previous games where you were allowed to move freely within the castle and on the grounds.[CR]The game is divided into several non-consecutive levels, some of which are locked at the beginning of the game until the player collects enough Triwizard Shields to unlock it.[CR]It is noted as the last Harry Potter game released on GameCube and Xbox, it is also the first Harry Potter Game to get an E10+ Rating in North America.</plot>

		<plot>In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Voldemort is tightening his grip on both the Muggle and wizarding worlds and Hogwarts is no longer the safe haven it once was. Harry suspects that dangers may even lie within the castle, but Dumbledore is more intent upon preparing him for the final battle that he knows is fast approaching. Together they work to find the key to unlock Voldemort's defenses and, to this end, Dumbledore recruits his old friend and colleague, the well-connected and unsuspecting bon vivant Professor Horace Slughorn, whom he believes holds crucial information. Meanwhile, the students are under attack from a very different adversary as teenage hormones rage across the ramparts. Harry finds himself more and more drawn to Ginny, but so is Dean Thomas. And Lavender Brown has decided that Ron is the one for her, only she hadn't counted on Romilda Vane's chocolates! And then there's Hermione, simmering with jealously but determined not to show her feelings. As romance blossoms, one student remains aloof. He is determined to make his mark, albeit a dark one. Love is in the air, but tragedy lies ahead and Hogwarts may never be the same again. In the game, players will return to Hogwarts to help Harry survive a fraught sixth year. They will also have a chance to engage in exciting wizard duels, mix and brew magical ingredients in Potions class and take to the air to lead the Gryffindor Quidditch team to victory. Players may even get sidetracked by Ron's romantic entanglements as they journey towards a dramatic climax and discover the identity of the Half-Blood Prince.</plot>

		<plot>The first Harvest Moon game for the PS2 takes a little deviance from all the other games in the series. The goal this time around is to save your town from being turned into a resort next year. The game focuses more on relationships than making money - which is the goal in all other Harvest Moon games to date. You still are running a farm and must succeed in the life of a farmer, but the actual gameplay rewards those who interact with the townspeople over those who just work the fields.</plot>

		<plot>The King Athellion has left his homeworld to fight in an intergalactic crusade. He left behind a huge bell - The Golden Voice - for his people to call him should they ever be in danger. During his absence however, the evil Lord Vetch invades the planet and enslaves Athellion's people by infecting them with a deadly virus. A virus, that requires a constant treatment with an antidote called catana. As the only one controlling the catana-support, Lord Vetch was easily able to force everyone to work for him. In order to prevent Athelion's return he has hidden The Golden Voice and soon it was forgotten along with the king's promise. Forgotten until Haven, one of the slaves, starts having dreams about a hill and a bell; dreams whose meaning he does not understand. When the news of the Haven's dreams reach Lord Vetch, he orders to murder him. Haven manages to escape and eventually learns about the real meaning of his dreams and is determined to find The Golden Voice and put an end to Lord Vetch' reign.[CR]Haven is a fast-paced, action-packed platformer but it also incorporates elements of several other genres. Haven can pick up many different weapons and parts of the game play more like a Shoot'Em Up than a platformer. There are also several vehicles to control, ranging from speedboats and jetcars to gliders ,spaceships and jetpacks. Despite all these action elements, there are also some slower paced levels, which put more emphasize on puzzle-solving and exploration.[CR]Haven's conceptual artwork was done by Rodney Matthews, a fairly well-known English sci-fi/fantasy artist, which is evident in Haven's surrealistic, bizarre design.</plot>

In the top right of the screen you have a radar which will track your movements and those of the enemy. Jack has a few moves at his disposal. He can duck and roll, push, pull and climb objects as well as flatten himself up against a wall. Using this technique he can peek around corners for a better view of the action, and then attack from this position, using the wall as protection.[CR]Between levels, Jack has a motorcycle that he uses to transport himself between various locations in the city according to the clues he receives. You will need to earn skill points however before you can arrive at a destination. Certain parts of the city are unavailable until you have gained the appropriate Headhunter license.[CR]As you have no recollection of your past, you have to take a series of licenses that will grant you access to greater parts of the city, weaponry and gadgets. These are taken in a VR simulator known as the Law Enforcement Intelligence and Licence Approval (LEILA). At various times in the game you will need to go to the LEILA building and upgrade your licence by practising your combat, stealth and driving skills.</plot>

		<plot>In the 21st century, a dreadful virus wiped out millions. The vaccine was found, but at the time the world was engulfed into chaos. A new world order emerged, splitting the world into two distinct yet dependent worlds: Above and Below.[CR]The world Above reflects a chrome city, a high-rise, high-tech metropolis served by elevators and elevated freeways. A place for hardworkers and law-abiding people. On the contrary to Above, the world Below, which is the product of earthquake damages, is a subterranean network of labour colonies. Those who are not wanted Above for one reason or another are sent Below.[CR]One day, now veteran Headhunter, Jack Wade, took a call to investigate an intrusion to the upper levels. Facing the trespasser, Jack saw a potential in the girl and instead of turning her in, he gave her a second chance... to become his apprentice. Jack is back, but this time, he's not alone but accompanied by his sidekick Leeza X. Together, they will face whatever threat lurks from the world Below.[CR]The gameplay is set in 3rd-person view with ability to rotate camera or set it behind your back at the single click. Headhunter's main accessory is IRIS (Intelligent Realtime Information Scanner). Once you get the IRIS, you'll be able to scan every item just by pointing the gun at it, or use the scanner in 1st-person view which will let you examine the surroundings in more detail. Also, IRIS will provide you with a full 3D map info even displaying the enemies so you can avoid them or use stealth if necessary. Enemies will hear you running and shooting, so if you decide to take an action, be aware that they will surround you and launch a team strike at you from all the sides. You only effective aid against them, beside your weapon, of course, is the ability to perform a roll or lean against the walls and fire from the corners, although aiming itself may not be easy as your hand will not be steady while on the move or panicking.</plot>

		<plot>Heavenly Guardian was originally a PS2 sequel to Taito's Kiki KaiKai series (better known as Pocky and Rocky outside of Japan) called simply Kiki KaiKai 2. The game was canceled, as Starfish lost the Kiki KaiKai license, but would later resurface as a Wii game entitled Kiki Kai World. Kiki Kai World was mostly similar to the canceled PS2 game, but with the main character's miko outfit recolored from red to blue. Instead of being a direct sequel to the original, it was more of a "spiritual successor," as to avoid legal issues with Taito and its parent company, Square-Enix.</plot>

		<plot>Gerdy, an apprentice herder, embarks on a quest to rescue his father from an evil spell. His journey takes him across an island of diverse territories, populated by an assortment of wild creatures, each of which form part of a complex inter-related food chain. To avenge his father's nemesis and restore goodness to the island, Gerdy must hone his herding skills and ultimately compete in a tournament to become Master Herder.[CR]Herdy Gerdy is primarily a platform game with strategy and puzzle elements. The levels involve Gerdy traversing hazardous areas with timed jumps, avoiding or destroying obstacles. However, a significant portion of the gameplay is dedicated to collecting various animals, leading them onto a safe path, similarly to Lemmings. Each of the animals has its own behavior and skills (e.g. swimming), requiring the player to utilize different tactics to capture them.</plot>

		<plot>The classic turn-based gameplay established by the Might and Magic series comes to the PlayStation 2 in this release, complete with graphical enhancements and new features designed to make good use of the console's power. Players choose a hero to lead across the land on a quest to smite evil, gain power, and recover an immensely powerful artifact known as the "Dragon Bone Staff." [CR]In a blend of RPG and strategy elements familiar to veterans of the game's many incarnations on the PC, the player may choose to lead his army on side adventures to defeat wanted criminals or to recruit powerful allies, always watching for clues to the location of the elusive Dragon Bone Staff along the way. When the relic is finally found, the chances are slim that it will be unguarded. The secrets gleaned and skills gained on the quest that leads the hero to the staff may also decide the victor of the final battle.</plot>

		<plot>In High Rollers Casino, you navigate a Las Vegas style casino environment with a male or female character you create from pre-selected options (head, hair, etc.), or you may create a character with the mix and match generator. Along with the character parts, the character's voice is also pre-set. Creating a character is required to play, and only one player may play at a time. Once a character is generated, you may enter the casino, which you navigate by walking around, and is viewed from a third person perspective of your character.[CR]Table games (where you play against a dealer) include Blackjack (including Blackjack, Spanish 21, Double Exposure, and Triple-7), Caribbean Stud Poker, Craps, Let It Ride, Mini Baccarat, Pai Gow Poker, Roulette, Sic-Bo (similar to Roulette, except with three dice in a cage), and Three Card Poker. Machine games include Slots, Video Keno, Video Poker and Video Slots. Poker games include 5 Card Draw, 7 Card Stud, Omaha, Omaha 8's or Better, Razz, and Texas Hold 'Em. You may play the table and machine games by going directly to them to start, but you must go to the Poker Manager to play the poker games.[CR]In addition to the Poker Manager, other features available in the casino include the Bartender, who is responsible for explaining the rules for the games, and providing tutorials for playing them. The Cashier will help you when you are out of money by providing markers, or letting you sell prizes won in tournaments. The Elevator lets you access your game play statistics, clothing options, prizes, and VIP status, and the Casino Manager provides information about prizes, handles VIP access, and allows you to enter tournaments. Competing in tournaments requires an entry fee of differing amounts, but if won, you gain all of the other player's entry fees. If you win consecutive tournaments, you win Tournament Bonus prizes which may be cashed in at the Cashier.[CR]As your bankroll increases, you gain VIP status and corresponding VIP cards (Silver, Gold, and Platinum) which increase your ranking and unlocks an additional costume for your character. Gaining the High Rollers card just gives you the High Roller Ranking. These are collected at the Casino Manager's booth. You may access the menu at any time to go directly to a game, change system settings like music and sound volume, game settings and clearing game statistics, help to get detailed game rules and betting options, and to save and load your game.</plot>

		<plot>Weapons of the war are portrayed accurately and have corresponding reloading processes. For example, the rifled musket reloading process is lengthy, while the revolver's is quick. The game fails to separate the two factions and has one rifled musket, the Springfield. While the Confederates used them as field pickups they primarily used the Pattern 1853 Enfield.[CR]Melee combat is also a large part of the game, just as it was during the war. The Bowie knife and the cavalry saber are some of the melee weapons.[CR]Each battle can be played on one of three difficulty modes: Easy, Normal and Hard. Completing the game on any mode unlocks an achievement.[CR]No multiplayer features are present in the title, but the Xbox 360 version does support Leaderboards on Xbox Live. While the game specifications do include Downloadable Content, no content was released.</plot>

		<plot>The game begins with a cutscene showing a wounded Agent 47 wandering through a dark hotel corridor and arriving at his room. Upon entering, he collapses and begins to have flashbacks regarding previous assassinations he committed, beginning with the aftermath of killing Dr. Ort-Meyer at the end of the original game. The missions are primarily focused on replays of previous missions in the original game, except played in reverse. The graphics, maps and artificial intelligence have been improved and modified. Perhaps due to 47's feverish state of mind as he remembers these past missions, it is raining in nearly every level. In the game, 47 visits several locations, including Romania, Kamchatka, the United Kingdom, Rotterdam, Budapest, Hong Kong, and finally Paris.</plot>

		<plot>Hitman 2 features mission-based gameplay. On each level, the main character, known only as 47, is given a set of objectives to complete. Most levels require the assassination of one or more people. However, how missions are completed is up to the player, and there are almost always a variety of ways to complete missions. Instead of simply running and gunning through the mission, one can set sneaky traps, like poisoning a drink, to terminate the target in silence.

		<plot>I Ninja is a 3D platform title starring an original character created by British developer Argonaut Software. Players control a spirited young ninja as they make their way through a diverse selection of indoor and outdoor locales. The title character is garbed in a blue suit and matching hooded mask, so that only his eyes and his expressive brow are visible to players. The character also wields a pair of katana blades in both hands as he jumps from platform to platform, avoiding hazards and slicing at enemies. The cartoon-style atmosphere is brought to life with the use of cel-shaded graphics, giving the game a distinctive look from many of its platform contemporaries.[CR]I-Ninja is an adrenaline-charged adventure game. An ultra-cool ninja with major attitude meets extreme sports game play, I-Ninja is the consummate warrior who has spent years mastering his weapons and honing his skills. In true gravity defying game play, I-Ninja can scale buildings, "shred" on extreme rails, hover great distances with a "sword copter", ride drifting roller spheres and utilize specialized manga-style ninja moves to navigate through each dynamic environment.</plot>

		<plot>In this game, Scrat is caught up in the events of the film, Ice Age: The Meltdown and is trying to pursue acorns while interacting with some characters, some of whom help him in his quest. The game starts off by showing the icy areas where it began in the film and moving on to the woods, as well as exploring regions in the games such as the bowels of the sea reptile, Maelstrom, and swampy lands. In the game, Scrat occasionally allies himself with some of the main characters, and the player sometimes can play as either Sid or Diego, though not Manny. Characters which were shown as bit parts in the film are shown usually as adversaries or (in the case of one, a songbird) a guide to the next nut, though a select number of foes were not shown in the film at all.</plot>

		<plot>The game's main protagonist is Ico, a young boy with a pair of horns on his head—considered a bad omen by his village. As part of the village's tradition, he is taken by a group of warriors to a castle surrounded by water and locked inside one of the sarcophagi in a crypt. Some time after the warriors depart, a tremor runs through the castle, and Ico is able to take advantage of it to escape his confines. As he searches the castle, he comes across Yorda, a captive girl who speaks in an unknown language. Ico helps Yorda escape, but finds that she is hunted by shadow-like creatures (the souls of other horned children sacrificed to the fortress) that attempt to drag her body into the portals from which they emerged. Though Ico cannot be harmed by the shadows and is able to drive them away from Yorda, he finds he cannot defeat the enemies with his simple weapons. The pair make their way through the abandoned castle, eventually arriving at the bridge leading to land. As they cross, the Queen, ruler of the fortress and Yorda's mother, appears and tells Yorda that as her daughter she cannot leave the castle. Ico and Yorda attempt to flee, but the Queen destroys part of the bridge in their path; although Yorda tries to save him, Ico falls off the bridge and loses consciousness.[CR]Co-Op Info: This mode is only available after completing the game. One player control Ico while the other controls Yorda. Only player 1 has control of the camera.</plot>

		<plot>Inuyasha: The Secret of the Cursed Mask is based on an anime series of the same name. You can play either as a teenager boy or a teenager girl, named by the player. The two scenarios are very similar and basically follow the same story: you live in modern-day Tokyo and one day discover a strange symbol in an old storehouse. As a result, you are transported to medieval Japan. You encounter the half-demon Inuyasha, who introduces you to Kagome Higurashi, the heroine of the anime series. Together you embark on a journey to retrieve scattered pieces of the Sacred Jewel and to find a way to get back home.[CR]This is a fairly traditional Japanese-style RPG with random encounters and turn-based combat viewed from over-the-shoulder perspective. You can attack physically, use special techniques, and power up to combo attacks with multiple characters.</plot>

		<plot>Iridium Runners is a futuristic running game that pits competitors against each other on hazard-riddled race tracks in foot races. Players can choose one of 20 characters that have unique running skills and techniques. Some of the characters and tracks can only be unlocked as the game progresses.[CR]All of the runners will do just about anything to win, so the action can become down and dirty. Almost anything goes during the races including knocking opponents completely off the track with a well-placed kick, fist or weapon. Power-ups and booster items are scattered around the course for increasing performance, speed or providing a new method of attack. Strategy comes into play by knowing which character and which "pod" sidekick to choose.[CR]There are three modes of play: Single Race, Cup and Championship. Each offers unique environments, different obstacles and challenges.[CR]The Single Player game will put the player up against 5 CPU opponents. Multiplayer is offline and includes Deathmatch and Team modes (2 players on 2 teams) and up to 4 players in split screen.</plot>

		<plot>The boys of Jackass put their nuts on the line time and time again in this videogame based on the MTV franchise, allowing players to try out a series of scenarios with digital incarnations of Steve-O, Johnny Knoxville, and the rest of the cast. Complex physical dynamics allow the chaos of the Jackass acts to come to life in the game, as each brutal, bone-jarring, blood-spurting stunt is different from the last and as each stunt challenges you to act even more crazy and wild. With more than 35 unique scenarios, players will get to virtually experience Jackass stunts too extreme for even their wildest dreams - from careening down the streetsof San Francisco in a garbage can while dodging traffic to running off on a golf cart at a golf course while trying to hit every destructible object in the way.</plot>

		<rom name="ps2-redump-usa-chd-part-J/Jade Cocoon 2 (USA).chd" size="1665723243"/>
		<plot>Presenting a combination of monster breeding and RPG elements, Jade Cocoon 2 expands upon Genki's original title in a number of significant ways. Gameplay comprises a familiar mix of storytelling and monster raising, with significant tweaks implemented for good measure. The town acts as your base of operations and it's here you can stock up on supplies, or take jobs for which you can earn money and build a reputation. The latter proves vital as it's directly related to the number of monsters you can use in battle. The successful completion of certain tests rewards you with the ability to command more beasts -- up to a maximum of 12 at once, however, you can only take these tests when your reputation is high enough.[CR]These trials take place in the Arena, which is also home to Beast Hunter battles, where you can test your mettle against fellow Beast Hunters. Monster eggs are found on your travels and can be hatched in the Room of Life; an all-encompassing monster management room that provides detailed information on the beasts and allows you to merge them, creating hybrid creatures. The monsters now also evolve over time. Your amulet consists of 12 slots, three for each of the four elements. Your creatures are placed in positions on the amulet corresponding to their position in battle, and during combat they'll attack the enemy and defend you from harm. Their amulet position also dictates the effectiveness of their elemental powers. [CR]The storyline starts 100 years after the original adventure, with the Cocoon Masters having become the stuff of myth and legend. Beast Hunters are the modern equivalent, and players take on the role of Kahu; an aspirant Beast Hunter. A chance encounter results in Kahu being cursed, and he, along with a fairy named Nico, must rid his body of the curse or die. Levant (the original title's protagonist) is now a guardian and acts as your guide.</plot>

Jak 3 largely focuses on the Wasteland, a large desert only briefly referred to in the previous entry in the series as being completely uninhabited and inhospitable.[CR]Spargus City, a large settlement within the Wasteland bordering the ocean, is where the game officially begins, and serves as a hub for the player, where new weapons and upgrades can be earned, and most missions are given out.</plot>

		<plot>The game begins with Jak and Daxter, the protagonists, and Samos, their guardian, watching as Keira, Samos’ daughter and Jak’s love interest, demonstrate the Rift Rider and Precursor Rift Gate that they found in the previous game. When activated, the Rift opens a portal, and a large ominous atmosphere and a monster appear. Jak launches the Rider through the gate, past the monster. Jak and Daxter, separated from Keira and Samos, arrive in the segregated dystopia known as Haven City. They are separated on arrival, and Jak is captured by the city's Krimzon Guard. While Jak is imprisoned, he undergoes experiments with Dark Eco under the command of the city's leader: Baron Praxis. Jak, along with previous prisoners in the city jail, were experimented on for Operation: Dark Warrior, a project that consisted of injecting prisoners with dark eco in order to give them super-human abilities to be used in Haven City's war against animalistic creatures called Metal Heads. Jak, the only prisoner to survive the experiments, is altered mentally and physically, turning him (temporarily under random and controlled spasms) into a deadly monster.</plot>

You even have the ability to take the tour yourself, and see your park as your visitors see it.[CR]One of the most important objects is the Ranger Station. With this building, you can have helicopters patrol your park to watch for any disasters. If a dino should escape, you have the option of entering the helicopter in a first person view to try to shoot the dino with a tranquilizer dart. If you want to stick to building only, you can let the AI capture the dino.[CR]In order to breed a dinosaur, you must hire a team to locate fossils, then you must have the fossils analyzed. The whole process takes a while, but the longer you let your teams work, the longer your dino will live, and the happier your visitors will be. Force the team to give you the results early, and your dino might only live for ten days.[CR]The different dino's require different resources. Herbivores require lots of trees and grass, while carnivores require goats and cows. Your carnivores may get tired of being fed, so you might have to send in a smaller sized dino (a raptor in a T-Rex pen, for example), for the larger dino to hunt.[CR]The game includes multiple camera angles. You can rotate 360 degrees, zoom in and out, enter "visitor" cam, ride on the safari, take a scenic tour in a hot air balloon, or look out the helicopter.</plot>

		<plot>You are Rico Rodriguez, a CIA-agent who is sent to the small Island of San Esperito to start a revolution and bring down the current regime under the rule of General Salvador Mendoza.[CR]After you jumped out of the airplane and helped your local contact survive an attack by gang members, you have - much like GTA: San Andreas - the freedom to do what you want. The complete island is accessible from the beginning and you can either follow the main storyline, engage in side-missions, or collect items all over the place. To help the revolution you can also drive the government out of the individual sectors on the island. This is accomplished by a three-stages fight in which you have to go up against a huge army of government forces.[CR]As a fully trained agent, Rico can also perform many stunts. He has always an parachute equipped which he can open whenever he has enough speed. So he often uses cars or bikes as a jump-pad and then sails smoothly into the sunset.[CR]But of course he cannot impress the evil regime with that, so he also has access to a wide range of weapons from pistols with unlimited ammo to rocket launchers and machine guns. Rico is also trained to drive everything that has an engine, from a normal bike to a fully-armed military helicopter.</plot>

		<plot>Karaoke Revolution and its many sequels are video games for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Nintendo GameCube, Wii, Xbox, and Xbox 360, developed by Harmonix and Blitz Games and published by Konami in its Bemani line of music games. The Original Concept for Karaoke Revolution was created by Scott Hawkins and Sneaky Rabbit Studios.[1] Technology and concepts from the game were subsequently incorporated into Harmonix's game Rock Band.[CR]The Japanese versions of the game are developed by Konami themselves. The gameplay also differs significantly. Rather than a game per se, it is merely a karaoke system for the PlayStation 2, with no judgments.[CR]The game does not attempt to understand the singer's words, but instead detects their pitch. As such, singers can hum to a song or sing different lyrics without penalty. The game adapts to the player singing in a different octave than the song, to accommodate players whose vocal ranges do not fit the song.[CR]The songs in the game are covers of pop hits frequently sung in karaoke bars. This contrasts with the SingStar series from Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, which features only original artist recordings along with the music videos, where available. However, the 2009 remake of the game (titled Karaoke Revolution, just like the original) features all master tracks.</plot>

		<plot>The King of All Cosmos accidentally destroyed the stars and—having recovered—wants the prince to rebuild them. Unfortunately the prince stands a little less than half a foot tall, so recreating the stars will require some effort. Enter the Katamari, a sphere the prince can push around our world to “roll up” items increasing the Katamari’s size until it’s suitable for the King.[CR]Taking place in stylized versions of Japanese houses, cities, and environs, the prince pushes the Katamari around collecting items which adhere to it. At first, the prince can only pick up smaller items, but as the Katamari grows, the more it can collect. Push pins and paper clips cling to the Katamari increasing its size so it can roll over obstacles and pick up bigger items. Over many levels, the Katamari can eventually pick up people, cars, and other bigger items.[CR]Players steer the Katamari from a third-person perspective using the analog sticks on the PS2. A tutorial stage takes the player through the controls and sets up the story as well as introducing a side story about a Japanese girl who can feel the cosmos. Wanting to challenge the prince, the King sets requirements on the Katamari’s size and sets time limits on the level. Bonus missions restore constellations and have their own restrictions. [CR]The world of Katamari Damacy is brought to life with off-beat animation and a catchy soundtrack. Players can find presents hidden in the levels that contain accessories for the prince. Two players can also battle head-to-head in a Katamari competition.</plot>

		<plot>Kessen is a strategy game that tells the story of the events that brought feudal Japan out of a century of civil war and installed the Tokugawa Shogunate as the dominant political entity for the next two hundred years.[CR]As either Tokugawa Ieyasu or his opponents, you'll engage in real time battles, including Sekigahara, one of the largest and most famous battles in Japanese history. Victory or defeat will steer you down a campaign trail, taking you either through the historical events of the time or down fictional 'what if?' scenarios. [CR]Battles take place in real time, with you instructing your various generals on where to lead their troops, who to engage, and what special actions to perform. These special actions, such as firing your cannons, charging your opponent, or unleashing a flight of arrows, are depicted in close-up, cinema-like cut-scenes. [CR]Before, after, and sometimes even during battles you'll be shown cut-scenes that depict the personal struggles of your various subordinates.</plot>

		<plot>It is a time of war. Many leaders from different factions fight to control their land. One such leader, Liu Bei, has only one wish: peace. But war stands in his way, after his land Shu is attacked by the kingdom of Wei, led by the warlord Cao Cao, who abducts Liu Bei's beloved Diao Chan, the keeper of the Imperial Seal. Liu Bei has to flee, but swears to return, exact revenge on Cao Cao, and liberate the kingdom of Shu.[CR]Kessen II is a real-time strategy game, and a follow-up to Kessen. Unlike the first game, it is set in the Chinese Three Kingdoms period. The account of historical events is heavily fictionalized in the game, liberally adding new sub-plots (such as the entire romance angle of the story) and supernatural elements. The player can choose to command the armies of either Liu Bei or Cao Cao in their respective scenarios.[CR]The gameplay is similar to that of the previous game, the most notable change being the shift to supernatural warfare, including the addition of magical attacks such as tornadoes, lightning strikes, earthquakes, meteor showers, etc. The player can now control 500 units at one time, as opposed to 100 in the previous game. New unit types (elite horsemen, elephant cavalry, etc.) have been added.</plot>

		<plot>In Kessen III the player takes control of Nobunaga Oda, and unlike the previous two games, you cannot choose a side to play on, and Nobunaga has one goal only... to unify the lands and rid his world of misery and suffering.[CR]Following the prequels, this game comes with lots of cinematics and stays true to strategic as well as action gameplay, adding a few new things along the road, like collecting items during battles.[CR]The two main aspects of this game are planning and engaging in battle. Select officers and strategically place them on the field of battle, assign commands and issue orders. When on the battlefield, each of the officers, including Nobunaga, will have his/her army at their disposal which can be controlled at any point. Level-ups bring additional special attacks to both officers and their troops.</plot>

		<plot>The game is set in an era of space colonization where the Helghast Empire has recovered from its defeat in the First Helghan War and launched a blitzkrieg against the outer Interplanetary Strategic Alliance (I.S.A.) colony planet Vekta. Vekta's orbital Strategic Defense (S.D.) platforms failed during the initial assault, allowing the Helghast to land swarms of soldiers onto the surface and making it all the more difficult for the outnumbered I.S.A. forces.[CR]In the game, the Helghast are a faction of human descendants who colonized the planet Helghan many generations ago. The planet's harsh environment forced the Helghast to adapt and mutate so much that they can no longer be considered human. They are stronger, faster and more resilient than their human cousins, and possess a burning hatred for humanity. Except for a small number of half-breed Helghast and trained troopers, they require a gas mask and air processing tank that creates air similar to that found on the planet Helghan.[CR]The player takes control of I.S.A. Captain Jan Templar, who is fighting off the Helghast invasion. Templar and his squad are called back to the base for reassignment, and are promptly sent to find the I.S.A. operative Gregor Hakha and the information in his possession. During the course of the game, the player also takes control of several other characters, such as Shadow Marshal Luger (a female special operations assassin), a heavy weapons specialist Staff Sergeant Rico Velasquez (a Helghast-hating soldier with an itchy trigger finger), and Colonel Hakha, a half-Helghast, half-Human spy.[CR]As the game progresses the player discovers that General Stuart Adams, a high ranking ISA officer, is a traitor and a servant of Joseph Lente (the commanding General of The Third Helghast Special Forces Army) and was responsible for sabotaging the SD platforms, rendering them unable to defend against the Helghast. The Earth Defense Fleet (EDF) go to assist the Vektan Army, however Adams kills General Voughton and receives his security key, allowing him to reboot the platforms, and prepare an ambush for the EDF relief force.[CR]Jan and the others confront Lente, only to find out that Hakha was a commander in chief for him. Lente says that Hakha's family was ashamed to even be related to him, except his brother who talked of his heroism. Because of this, Lente had Hakha's brother shot down. With anger in his eyes, Hakha shoots Lente dead.[CR]The team fly to the central SD platform and confront Adams, who is wounded by Templar. The platform begins to break up and Adams is killed by falling debris while trying to escape. Finally, the team restore the SD platform, allowing the EDF fleet to fight off the Helghast.</plot>

Everything from the Kinetic Suit technology to aggressive opposition delivers an adrenaline-filled racing experience. [CR]Kinetica: The race for which the Kinetic Suit was invented, and the most extreme physical challenge known to man. Kinetic Suits, scientifically advanced exoskeletons, fuse with individuals, allowing them to harness excessive speed, incredible agility, and unique technology that enables them to adhere to almost any surface.

		<plot>SNK once again reinvents its long running scrapping series and manages to invigorate the genre at the same time with fine backgrounds including a luscious aquarium. Intelligent use of the 'striker' character is essential to progress and there are plenty of potential candidates who rush on launching a scathing attack, then disappear after a bit of taunting. With thirty-five slickly animated playable characters to choose from matched by the same number of strikers there's plenty to get your teeth (and fists) into. Just try and resist the urge to unleash the desperation move until the time is right. .</plot>

After the controversial resurgence of the Orochi power in the 2003 King of Fighters tournament, the tournament and the fighters return after a two year break in the action. Some are motivated to investigate the new Orochi situation and the antagonistic fighter Ash Crimson, while others enter the tourney to settle old scores...[CR]The King of Fighters XI features a roster of 33 "team" characters, 7 PS2 exclusive characters, 5 mid-boss characters and 2 boss characters. In total, this allows a player to choose between +40 characters. Many of the characters are returning fighters from the other games in the KOF series, though notable new faces exist in the effective forms of Oswald, Duck King, Bonne Jenet, Elisabeth Blanctorche and Gai Tendo.</plot>

		<plot>Sora, Donald and Goofy travel down a long road that meanders through endless fields, and come to a crossroads. As Sora stands in the crossroads, he gazes up at the night sky and thinks of his lost friends. Just then, a mysterious man approaches from down one of the branching paths. "Ahead lies something you need," he says, "but to claim it, you must lose something dear." The man vanishes before a single path, leading to a castle that eerily resembles a girl's drawing... In the coming journey, what will Sora and his companions gain, and what will they lose? In addition to Sora, players can control Riku in this adventure that bridges the gap between KINGDOM HEARTS and KINGDOM HEARTS II A full 3D remake of the original GBA release, KINGDOM HEARTS Re:Chain of Memories offers a refreshing rendition of the hit title for the PlayStation 2 system. The talented voice cast from the North American releases of KINGDOM HEARTS and KINGDOM HEARTS II, including David Gallagher and Haley Joel Osment, return to breathe new life into the beloved characters. The mini-game catalog has been completely renewed, now with four brand new experiences accompanying the main adventure.</plot>

		<plot>Kuon is a horror game set in Heian period (12th century) in Japan. You control three protagonists in the game. The story revolves around a man named Doman, an exorcist who was summoned by one of the noblemen to investigate a cursed manor. His daughter Utsuki is out to search for him when he doesn't return, and her sister is charmed by demons inhabiting a mysterious castle, turning into a demon herself. A young girl named Sakuya, Doman's disciple, also ventures into the depths of the demonic world, to prove herself worthy of her master. Once the player completes Utsuki's and Sakuya's scenarios, he unlocks the third scenario where he experiences the story from the point of view of Doman himself.[CR]The game is a mixture of third-person action and puzzle-solving. As in all survival horror games, your means of defense are limited and scarce. Unlike most games of the kind, physical attacks with weapons are not your only way to defend yourself against hordes of undead creatures. You can also learn and cast spells in the game, and even summon creatures (wolves, spiders, etc.) to fight at your side.</plot>

		<plot>Kya and her brother Frank have been transported into a different dimension, and upon arriving are separated! Kya meets (and is saved by) the native creatures of this world (known as the Nativs), however Frank is captured by a dangerous enemy known as the Wolfens under the rule of Brazul. To make matters worse, Kya learns that the Wolfens are actually the peaceful Nativs which have been captured and transformed, and Brazul is actually her long lost father! Kya must now embark on a quest to rescue her brother as well as find a way to restore the Wolfen to their Nativ form and defeat Brazul.[CR]Kya: Dark Lineage is an action adventure game. You control Kya and need to explore the colorful world she's arrived in. This strange world consists of various floating islands with many tunnels, platforms, dangerous life forms, and other obstacles. Powerful winds blow around many areas, and you'll often need to use the winds to your advantage by floating in them through tunnels, over gaps or slowing your descent in a free fall. There is some puzzle solving as well; you'll need to locate objects to use, hop on various platforms, buy items in the Nativ city, and more to reach new areas.[CR]You'll also need to fight often, as the Wolfen are numerous and can found guarding many areas you need to get through. You can fight with your fists as well as items that can be acquired (such as various boomies, or boomerangs, and fighting bracelets). After defeating a Wolfen, you can use a magic spell to transform it back to its Nativ form which will then return back to the Nativ city. Upon returning to the city, many of the Nativs will then open up a shop; as new shops are opened, you will have the opportunity to buy new items and power ups to help on your quest. Alternatively, some Nativs may instead build a challenge in the city instead of opening a shop. You can earn money by betting and completing challenge objectives (or you can simply practice a challenge).[CR]As you progress through the game, the story will unfold until you are (hopefully) successful in your quest!</plot>

		<rom name="ps2-redump-usa-chd-part-L/LEGO Island Xtreme Stunts (USA).chd" size="419865691"/>
		<plot>Island Xtreme Stunts is a mixture of different genres in a single game. The player explores a LEGO-based environment in an open world format: ride a skateboard, drive, fly and pilot a range of vehicles all whilst performing stunts and tricks while taking on the bad guy, Brickster. The player is cast as Pepper Roni, a lead stuntman in a big movie production set on LEGO Island.[CR]Even though the player is free to go wherever he wants, there is a story behind the game divided over 25 missions. All the missions are stunt-based. Running around the world in 3rd-person view, the controls are pretty basic and do not offer the trick combinations of other stunt/trick-based games. It is easy to pick up and play, even for the younger players, without worrying too much about what button combination will do what trick. Instead the player can focus on the missions by only having to complete basic tricks with a few button presses.[CR]During the quests players can collect trading cards to unlock mini-games. Other features include bricks to create "Brickimals" and the ability to change LEGO Island objects.</plot>

Not wanting to accept his defeat, Rocket Racer issues a new race challenge and summons the greatest racers of all time to the Ramas's dome for the Galactic Racing Championship![CR]You must prove your driving skills in four different worlds to qualify for the ultimate race on planet Xalax. Play through new features as you race your way to the championship. Just as in the original LEGO Racers, you've got to build your racer and minifigure driver first. Once behind the wheel, you'll notice the improved destructability, as cars and scenery break into individual LEGO bricks on impact. You can regain your bricks during a pit stop, but don't lose 'em all, otherwise you've got to hoof it to the pit.[CR]The game lets you explore the Life on Mars, Adventurers: Dino Island, Arctic, and City Center LEGO worlds. Each has a "boss" racer that drives a vehicle unique to that world, and you've got to beat the boss before advancing. Realistic weather conditions add to the excitement. Twenty-four new tracks combine to form a network of roads--some with movable barriers that form different courses. An improved power-up system helps racers and an all-new Golden Brick system awards you when you win. You can also pick Golden Bricks up along the course; collect enough and you'll advance to the next world, where you'll access new bonus levels.</plot>

		<plot>Gameplay in Lego Star Wars is geared towards family play, and as such does not feature a game over scenario. Given a specific set of characters in each scenario, based on a scene from each of the movies, up to two players can control them, using their different abilities. By walking up to another friendly character, the player can switch control over to that character, which is necessary for using some of their abilities to complete puzzles. Studs can be found by finding them, smashing or using the force on certain objects, or defeating enemies. Players will lose studs however if their character is destroyed (as opposed to losing lives). These studs can be spent on unlocking new characters for Free Play mode. Certain segments of the game feature players controlling spaceships flying on a flat plane. There are also several minikit canisters hidden throughout each level that, when collected, come together to form a vehicle. Completing certain requirements, such as collecting enough studs in a level, earns Golden Bricks that can be traded for cheats.[CR]When the player first starts the game, they must first complete Chapter I of The Phantom Menace. However, once that chapter is completed, the player may choose to play levels from the other two movies, able to play any unlocked levels in their desired order. Completing all the game's levels with full stud bars will unlock an additional chapter based on the opening scene of A New Hope.</plot>

		<plot>A group of people known as Mystics live like outcasts, shunned by most humans because of their unique connection to the world of spirits: they are able to summon powerful supernatural beings called Origins. A small village of Nohl is a refuge for Mystics; one of them is a young swordsman named Lang, whose duty is to protect a crystal that supplies the town with water. One day, Lang meets a mysterious man who manipulates him into giving up the crystal. Determined to correct his mistake, Lang sets on a journey to retrieve the crystal, on which he will learn more of the role the Mystics and their Origins play in the world.[CR]Legaia 2: Duel Saga is a follow-up to Legend of Legaia, though it is not directly connected to it story-wise, featuring a different cast of characters. Like its predecessor, it is a Japanese-style role-playing game with turn-based combat. The game utilizes a system called "Arts", which requires the player to press a combination of buttons corresponding to fighting moves during battles. These are divided into the sub-categories "Normal Arts" (basic moves), "Hyper Arts" (more powerful moves that require special points to be spent), "Mystic Arts" (Origin powers), and, finally, "Variable Arts" (team attacks).[CR]The game also features a Camping mode; accessing it, the player is able to communicate with the characters in the party, prepare meals from ingredients, and craft items such as weapons, armor, and accessories.</plot>

What makes this system different from ATB is that actions take different amounts of time based on the weapon or ability used, for example an axe will need more time than a dagger to attack.[CR]The game features a vast world to explore; there are several towns and a variety of monsters to combat. The game also features multi-player experience after unlocking the second character in the story.</plot>

		<plot>Legend of Kay is a classic action adventure with an advanced close combat fighting system.[CR]The young hero "Kay", a cat, rise to a challenge when emperor Shun - king of the mighty gorilla - invaded the island Yenching with his troops. Kay may be only a scholar, but he is a brave and agile fighter. He leaves his village only with his sword and soon becomes a seasoned fighter.[CR]The fights in Legend of Kay reminds of good old eastern martial-arts-movies. There are various moves the player can execute: uppercuts, back flips, somersaults, powerful magic attacks and you have the combo moves. When you gain a combo, you can auto aim at enemies, which makes it easy for the player to execute double- and triple blows.[CR]In the beginning you only have a sword but later in the game Kay receives steel claws and a powerful war hammer. All weapons can be upgraded.[CR]Kay has to fight against a lot of different enemies on ground and in the air. There are a lot of jump and run action, puzzles and of course many, many fights.</plot>

		<plot>Spyro wakes up late one night to discover that his rescued friend, Cynder, is running away from the temple where they live. Spyro (and reluctantly, his friend Sparx) chase after her. Little do they know that they are in for another adventure, where they will meet the mysterious Chronicler and eventually face off against Gaul, the Ape King.[CR]The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night is a 3D action platformer which takes place right after the events at the end of The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning. Players control Spyro as he searches for his friend Cynder. Initially, he has lost all of his different breath powers from the first game, but he gradually recovers the ability to breathe fire, ice, earth and electricity. New to this game is the ability for Spyro to slow down time using his newly-learned 'Dragon Time' ability.</plot>

		<plot>Electronic Arts' first game based on the Lord of the Rings movies is an action game with classic beat'em up-style gameplay. Despite the title, it covers events from both the first and the second film in the trilogy.[CR]Players, choosing to control Aragorn, Legolas or Gimli, must battle the evil forces of the Dark Lord Sauron in order to protect the Ring of Power and restore peace to Middle-earth. [CR]The player character moves through the levels, fighting hordes of Orcs, Goblins and other creatures with various attack and parrying moves. The more varied the attacks are and the less the player is hit, the more points are awarded for each kill. At the end of each level, kill points are accumulated and can be used to gain new abilities. Most of these are new attack moves, unleashed through various button combinations. Others increase health or upgrade the strength or speed of existing attacks. Each of the three characters has unique upgrades and moves.[CR]Several levels feature boss battles with the likes of the Watcher of Moria or Lurtz, leader of the Uruk-hai. Each boss requires a unique strategy to defeat.</plot>

MDK2 Armageddon rides wild on the throttling PlayStation 2, with maddening visual beauty and frenzied gameplay that gamers have come to expect from this quirky game.

You can keep tabs on yourself in career mode as and control which teams you want play for, but you have to earn you right to compete in the big leagues by battling your way up from the minor leagues. Keep track of your achievements as you progress and if you choose, you can even skip parts of the game to your at bats or pitching appearances, making the game much more streamlined and very personal. [CR]The players act very realistic due to the fact they used motion capturing for almost every major player, giving it untolds amounts of realistic animation and almost giving them real emotions, such as if a pitcher gives up a big home run, you can see the disappointed on his face or if you hit a game winning home run your entire team goes nuts celebrating.[CR]The game also comes with a fun set of mini games including the classic Home Run Derby and a new King of the Diamond, which has multiple levels, a timer and is constantly adapting to keep you guessing. The rosters even were up to date at the time, actually having the 2006 rosters instead of the previous year.</plot>

		<plot>To enhance gameplay and provide gamers with an authentic yet unique simulation, MLB 2006 has integrated new features, including the all-new Branch Point Technology (BPT), which provides seamless fielding transitions, smooth base running, and fluid transitions while in a run or a slide. Additionally, MLB 2006 incorporates new fielding and pitching interfaces to challenge the skill levels of all baseball videogame fans. A brand new Fielding Zone Marker brings the player's attributes together with the user's skill level, so gamers will truly have to make the play, while the new Pitcher Confidence feature binds player rating attributes with a gamer's skill level in order to determine a users ability to hit spots in the strike zone. A new Franchise Mode includes an all-new Player Morale System that tracks player morale on every level and applies it to the player's day-to-day performance, and the new Career Mode lets gamers play from the player's perspective and control their own destiny from the start to the finish of their career, based on their on-field performance.</plot>

		<plot>Midway's first extreme sports title that tackles the great American past-time... baseball. Take control of all of your favorite Major League Baseball teams and players armed with all of their real stats, attributes, abilities and attitude. Slugfest features many playable minigames, a season mode, quick play and exhibition play.[CR]So what makes MLB Slugfest extreme? The game is far from a real baseball simulation. This is as arcade as it gets. Flaming fastballs that take out batters ankles (and reducing their stats), out-of-the-park home runs, dropkicking the catcher on your dash to home plate, kidney punching the batter who just ruined your no-hitter and many other brutal tactics bring sportsmanship to an all-new low.[CR]Graphic touches include real player faces and details such as chewing gum and talking to teammates or opponents. Real stadiums all make their appearances along with several fantasy stadiums that can be unlocked.</plot>

		<plot>The second title in Midway's baseball series, SlugFest 20-04 continues to pour on the rough-housing gameplay, bizarre codes, and humorous commentary. In addition to the new Home Run Derby mode and Create-A-Team options, the game features the ability of pitchers to catch "On Fire" and impossible Special Pitches that zigzag, arc, and whizz by in ways that would leave any batter humiliated. New secret teams have been added to the previous bunch, including aliens, minotaurs, and Sub-Zero of Mortal Kombat fame. The customizable Instant Replay is another nice touch, allowing you to relive the awkward moments once you pause the game. And, of course, Tim Kitzrow and Jim Shorts return to the commentators' booth, making their signature random comments and incessant arguments.</plot>

		<plot>The 2011 installment of the Madden NFL series headlined new features such as a play-calling system titled "GameFlow", a new game mode titled "Online Team Play", and an assortment of other features. The game was advertised as being "Simpler, Quicker, and Deeper" than previous versions of the game. The superstar mode for the Wii version was removed from this Madden installment.[CR]"GameFlow" enables the player to create a situational game plan based on down and situation, and is advertised to speed up playing time as much as one half of the total game time from previous years of "Madden". Another addition is "Online Team Play", which supports 3 vs. 3 cooperative play. Players can also scout opponents in online head-to-head games to gain a competitive advantage. Other changes from previous installments include a new kick meter, new audible system, and an improved locomotion animation system. Lighting improvements, run blocking changes, new quarterback ratings, and a new Old Spice "Swagger" rating have also been added to the game.[2] Gus Johnson does the play-by-play broadcast commentary, replacing Tom Hammond. One reviewer noted, Johnson's "penchant for the dramatic in real life keeps you on the edge of your seat as you turn the corner for a RB sprint or heave a desperation Hail Mary." Cris Collinsworth returns as color commentator from previous editions.[3][4][5][CR]"Madden Ultimate Team": Madden Ultimate Team is a downloadable game mode released on January 7, 2010. In this mode, users are able to build a team by purchasing player packs. These packs are purchased with coins that are earned by winning a game, scoring a touchdown etc. They can also be purchased with real money through the user's PlayStation Network or Xbox Live accounts. As the user gains more coins, they are able to buy better packs of players, eventually building their "Ultimate Team".[6][CR]This mode has received some negative feedback with regards to 'Player Contracts' that are attached to each 'Player Card'. When purchased 'Player Cards' have a 10 match contract - this decreases by 1 every game (even if due to disconnection). When a 'Player Card' contract reaches zero you cannot use that player in your team until you replenish his contract. Replenishment of a contract on a 'Player Card' is done by a contract card that is purchased with coins. It is thus extremely difficult to keep a good team 'in contract' without spending real money. It is also possible to be in a position where you have a low amount of coins and not enough players to even play 'Madden Ultimate Team', unless you wish to spend real money for more coins. In order to buy contract cards to replenish your players contracts, or to buy new packs with - to try to fill the empty team positions that are stopping you from playing the mode</plot>

This installment features a new collision system, providing the player with more control, and adds over 100 new tackle animations.

This is integrated with the 'GamePlan' feature, enhanced from Madden NFL 11, by allowing players to rate their plays for each situation, and it thus interacts with the newly improved GameFlow system to allow players to pick between plays suggested by the game A.I. and based on their rating of the plays.</plot>

		<plot>Magic Pengel is centered on the player, as a character able to manipulate a "Pengel" (which looks like a stylized fairy combined with a paintbrush) to create a creature, or "Doodle". Using the Pengel (pronounced "pen-jell") as a cursor, the player simply sketches out the limbs, body, and other features. Depending on the amount of magic ink expended, and the types of body parts, the creature will be given certain statistics and created. With the help of Zoe and Taro, the character trains and battles using custom-created designs, which can be traded to or battled with the creations of other players. As the Doodles battle, they become more powerful, and earn points towards the purchase of pre-created Doodles, and extra abilities towards customizable creation. Combat functions according to three selections: attack, magic, and block, as well as a charge command. The three basic maneuvers follow a standard rock-paper-scissors methodology, but repetitiveness is minimized due to the varied attributes of the Doodles, as well as the inability to successively repeat any selection.</plot>

		<rom name="ps2-redump-usa-chd-part-M/Major League Baseball 2K9 (USA).chd" size="2545747327"/>
		<plot>Major League Baseball 2K9 is a simulation of the sport of baseball. The heart of the game is the franchise mode where the player can play whole seasons with its hundreds of matches and a managerial part. Besides keeping the balance, there are three main activities in this part: studying extensive statistics, player trading and hiring players through free agents. The latter is similar to other sports games: every player has other wishes for his team, e.g. athletic success. If the player's club can fulfill these wishes better the club has to pay less salary. Trading however is handled differently: Every club gives a value to the players on the roster. This value influences how the trading plays out. Training is another important part to consider.[CR]Matches can either be simulated or played manually. Every part of the match has its own control scheme: For pitching the player uses two parts of his input device: the first for aiming and the second to recreate a movement (depending on the used move). Batting is done by swinging the bat in the right timing. He can also influence the ball's direction in the way he hits it. During fielding the player basically tells the controlled player the direction in which he should throw the ball. Besides the franchise mode the player can participate in training, Home Run Derby and Postseason mode (play-offs). Players can unlock training cards.[CR]The are a few small differences between the versions: on the Wii the player controls batting and pitching directly with the remote and the nunchuck and the PSP version features slightly different fielding controls. In the franchise mode the player can manage up to four franchises in the PS2 version and there is a farming system on PSP.</plot>

		<plot>Makai Kingdom is the fourth Nippon Ichi-developed tactical RPG on PlayStation 2 and it follows closely in the footsteps of the previous games of the same style, which are Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, La Pucelle: Tactics and Phantom Brave.[CR]Lord Zetta, the king of Netherworld, tried to rewrite the history of the land but didn't succeed, and in the process brought demise onto himself. Three evil Overlords appeared before Zetta and promised to help him in his quest to take over the land once more. The player takes control of Zetta and his army to return Netherworld to its rightful owner.[CR]The game mechanics consist of several stages in which the player must defeat the enemy or fulfill other tasks to advance to the next level. Fighting is done in turns, meaning that once the player has moved and attacked, it's the enemy's turn to move his troops one by one. When the battle is won, the next level becomes selectable. Between fights, you can improve your squad of fighters by buying better weapons, recruiting more soldiers and so on.</plot>

You control the fate of the gallant Maximo, who returns home to find his kingdom in shambles. Your once trusted advisor, Achille has wrought evil on the land. Not only is the countryside filled with hoards of the roaming undead, but the four wise Sorceresses have been imprisoned at the four corners of the kingdom. To make matters worse, your girlfriend, Princess Sophia, has been forced to marry the scoundrel Achille. Talk about your bad days! Help Maximo rescue the Sorceresses, restore good to the kingdom, whup Achille’s butt, and, while you're at it...get your girl back![CR]Maximo is reminiscent of many of the old Capcom 2D platform games such as Ghouls n Ghosts, but the concept is revamped for the PS2 and done in crisp 3D graphics. The game is full of dynamic environments and tons of undead soldiers. The classic pick-up-and-play gameplay and stunning graphic sheen powered by the PlayStation 2 make Maximo a hero for the ages.</plot>

Briefings take place at the start of each mission, which advance the plot and introduce new characters. The smaller missions take place in a linear path, with the player fighting through towns and countryside, killing enemies and completing objectives. Objectives are explained to the character in a smaller briefing before each level, which prepares the player for that particular mission. The "War Room" serves as the game's main menu, and is reminiscent of Britain's secret underground intelligence bunkers during WWII.</plot>

Mega Man X3, also originally on the SNES, is based on its 32-bit update for the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and PC. The remaining three games are based on their PlayStation renditions. All the games now use save files, including the first few titles that originally necessitated a password for continuation, though upon loading save data, the player is still greeted with the old, fully-functional password entry screen, complete with the correct password to access the saved game. Mega Man Battle and Chase is a game that is unlocked after completing the first three games. It is a classic series kart-racing game previously unreleased in North America. Mega Man X Collection also contains unlockable artwork and music. Both the PlayStation 2 and GameCube versions are identical.</plot>

		<plot>The plot of Mega Man X7 takes place in the 22nd century during an age when humans coexist with humanoid robots called "Reploids". As some Reploids participate in violent and destructive crime, a police organization called the "Maverick Hunters" was established to stamp out this activity. As the Reploid conflicts proceed after the Nightmare phenomena event of Mega Man X6, the world is slowly recovering. But as always, Maverick crime is rising in newly constructed cities. As this new crime wave hits, X finds himself trying to answer moral questions that have plagued him since he joined the Maverick Hunters: "Are we doing the right thing to solve this matter?", leading him to the decision of "I've had enough of this violence." Unable to assuage his conscience, he drops from the battle frontlines and assumes a more strategic support role at headquarters. With X's retirement, a massive power vacuum ensues and many independent groups develop, trying to fill the void left by the hunter. Prominent among these groups is the "Red Alert Syndicate", growing large enough to become a dominant force. The Red Alert is a new group of Reploids, similar to the Repliforce, but consisting of vigilantes. They claim to hunt Mavericks, but apparently do more than that. One of their members, Axl, decides he's had enough of their "murdering" and tries to leave the group. Red, the group's leader, is angered by Axl deserting, and goes on a rampage to get Axl back.</plot>

		<plot>In the late 22nd century, humans have commenced a construction of an orbital elevator to the Moon. A Reploid named Lumine was put in charge of the project. Lumine belonged to the new generation of Reploids, which were apparently unable to become Mavericks (i.e. turn hostile towards humans). Soon thereafter, Lumine was kidnapped by unknown assailants. The team of Maverick Hunters, composed of X, Axl, and Zero, must pursue the abductors and find what they were truly after. However, they will also have to deal with familiar enemies from the past...[CR]Mega Man X8 is similar in visual style to earlier Mega Man X games, moving away from the 3D gameplay elements introduced by its predecessor. As in classic Mega Man games, the player is free to tackle the levels in any order, and must defeat a boss at the end of each. The player is able to control X, Axl, and Zero, which are distinguished by their gameplay style: X is able to equip body parts and armor, Axl specializes in guns and can also hover and glide in the air, while Zero focuses on short-range attacks.</plot>

		<plot>This release of Mercenaries 2: World in Flames differs from the other versions in several significant aspects. As opposed to the other releases, it uses the graphics engine from its predecessor Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction. Although the background story and basic gameplay remain the same, this version features about forty exclusive side-missions, has no co-operative play and takes place on a much smaller map.</plot>

		<plot>Since the incident on Shadow Moses Island, Metal Gear's top-secret technology has been leaked into the black market through the machinations of Revolver Ocelot. As a result, countless variations of Metal Gears have sprung up in every corner of the globe, making the weapon an increasingly common component of the armed forces of nuclear powers.[CR]In the midst of all of this, Solid Snake, now a member of the anti-Metal Gear group "Philanthropy," has learned that a new prototype Metal Gear has been developed by the U.S. Marines and is being transported in secret to an unknown destination. To learn more about this new machine, Snake must infiltrate the transport, disguised as a tanker, as it makes its way down the Hudson River.[CR]Just as Snake is about to begin his mission, however, the ship is seized by a mysterious and well-armed group bent on stealing the new Metal Gear for their own, nefarious purposes.</plot>

		<plot>A follow-up to the Metal Max games, Metal Saga is set in the same post-apocalyptic world as its predecessors - a world populated by bounty hunters, rangers, bandits, and mutant monsters. You take the role of a bounty hunter who has to travel the world, looking for "wanted" people. Accompanied by a soldier, a mechanic, and a cyborg dog, the hero must survive a journey west that will ultimately take him to remote places and lead him to battles against evil.[CR]Metal Saga has a less linear story line that one would normally expect from a Japanese RPG - a story line that develops according to the missions you decide to take, which in their turn lead to new events and finally to different endings. The combat system features traditional party management and turn-based battles, with the addition of Metal Max's trademark tank combat. When you acquire tanks for your characters, you can use them in battles. Tanks get damaged and broken, but you will be able to customize them by finding parts scattered across the world and assembling them to build new models. Based on the model of tank many different kinds of weapons, cannons, and accessories can be equipped to it, making for hundreds of different options. Tanks can even be given a custom paint job that is saved to the memory card.</plot>

This is accomplished by interacting with NPCs and becoming friends by giving them gifts and talking with them. Attract citizens by building up the town with offices, grocers, entertainment and farming buildings (to name a few).[CR]Rather than overlooking the environment, the player controls a character from a thirdperson perspective. Walking around, new constructions can be started and roads can be built. The buildings can be entered too. Side quests happen every level, some of which are quite strange. Expect to be involved in a smuggling ring or a cult.</plot>

On the tracks you can find weapons (e.g. a flamethrower, a monster-hammer or rockets) and power-ups that help you win the race. If you win a race you'll get money which you need to unlock new tracks and cars.[CR]In multiplayer mode up to 4 players can race against each other either on one PC or online. The PS2 version offers multiplayer with multitap and with the PSP version, you can play on one device (two players) or through WiFi (four players). Playing online also features a new twist in the races. If you want to, you can bet your car and if you lose your opponent gets it. You can also trade cars from your collection with others.[CR]An editor to design your own tracks is included in the package. Extra tracks can be unlocked by connecting the PSP to the PS2.</plot>

		<plot>Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition is a racing game, developed by Rockstar San Diego and published by Rockstar Games, and is the third game in the Midnight Club series. Like previous installments in the series, the game is an arcade-style racer and focuses on wild, high-speed racing, rather than realistic physics and driving characteristics. The name derived from a partnership between Rockstar and DUB Magazine, which features heavily in the game in the form of DUB-sponsored races and DUB-customized vehicles as prizes.</plot>

		<plot>Though advertised as a sequel to the PSOne game of a similar name (which was actually a localized Gunbird), Mobile Light Force 2 is in actuality the American repackaging of Alfa System's Japanese shooter Shikigami no Shiro. Changing its original inspiration's storyline completely, the game sends the US-only MLF team to Tokyo in an effort to combat hordes of invading demons. Along the way, one or two players can team up for simultaneous blasting with six different characters through four unique stages of traditional top-down shooting. The Japanese version of the game, however, utilizes completely different plot devices, has transitional cutscenes between each level, and has the option to increase the size of your viewable area.</plot>

		<plot>The game takes place entirely in Outer Space, although the Moon, space colonies, and asteroids are sometimes visited. The player pilots a wide variety of Mobile Suits, Mobile Armours, and other spacecraft throughout several different zero gravity environments. Also thrusters can be used to give these mobile weapons a temporary boost in speed and maneuverability. These vehicles can move forward, backward, and side to side using the left analog stick and can move up and down using the R1 and R2 buttons, allowing for 360 degree combat. The game is mostly free roaming, although a few rail shooter sections are commonly encountered.[CR]Players can use a large assortment of different main, sub, and melee weapons that vary greatly between different units. Certain crafts are also equipped with a special attack, which can be activated once a special meter has been filled. The game is divided into several different story modes, each corresponding to a different pilot or setting. These pilots range from main characters of the original Gundam series to lesser known pilots from the Gundam manga. The game also includes a two player multiplayer vs. mode. Players can also play against AI units in multiplayer. Finally there is a mode where players can create their own unique pilots for use in multiplayer.</plot>

		<plot>Mobile Suit Gundam: Journey to Jaburo is an action game based directly on the Mobile Suit Gundam films and series. The game begins at the start of the series and ends at the ending of the second film. The game plays in an action game format with a standard third person view. It features newly hand animated cutscenes that depict events from the original television series as well as a CGI opening depicting a space battle from the One Year War and then a scene of the Gundam destroying several Zaku IIs before being attacked by Char Aznable. It is also the prequel to Mobile Suit Gundam: Encounters in Space.[CR]The English dub of the video game features the voices of the actors who were cast for the Mobile Suit Gundam television series as with most games subsequent to the series' dubbing, rather than the English cast of the films.[CR]Journey to Jaburo takes place during the One Year War, and depicts the crew of the White Base making their way from the Side 7 sector of space colonies to the Federation headquarters at Jaburo. The game starts at Amuro Ray's home of Side 7, where three Zaku mobile suits attack the Federation's prototype mobile suit weapons. Amuro, in the confusion, fights the Zaku units in the Gundam, and is assigned to the White Base as the Gundam's pilot. After the White Base leaves the colony, it is pursued by Char Aznable, "The Red Comet".[CR]Char attacks the White Base during re-entry (where the power of the Gundam's beam rifle was revealed), which diverts them into the Zeon-controlled territory of North America. After going through many Zeon defenses (including Garma Zabi in Seattle), the White Base heads into Asia, where they battle Ramba Ral, an ace pilot who raised Sayla Mass when she was a child. After Ramba Ral commits suicide by jumping into Gundam's hand with a grenade, the White Base crew makes their way to Belfast for repairs.[CR]After they leave Belfast, they eventually make it to Jaburo, where Char's "Mad Angler" squadron finds the location of the base, and launches a massive attack to conquer it. The Zeon forces are beaten back, and the White Base, now dubbed the "13th Autonomous Mobile Squadron", heads out into space.</plot>

		<plot>Mobile Suit Gundam: Zeonic Front (known as Zeonic Front: Kidou Senshi Gundam 0079 [1] in Japan) is a game for the PlayStation 2, which revolves around a Zeon Special Commando Unit during the One Year War, called the Midnight Fenrir Corp. This MS team was created by Kycilia Zabi and participated in the capture of the California Base during the 2nd Earth Invasion Plan.[CR]Lt. Garret Schmitzer was a mobile suit veteran during the first stage of the One Year War, the One Week Battle back in January. At the end of the One Week Battle, Lt. Schmitzer was badly wounded, and forced into retirement. This was due to Operation British, the operation that would force a space colony, into the Earth's orbit for a collision course to South America, where the Federation's top forces were, Jaburo base.[CR]The injuries were extensive, but hope was on the horizon. Kycillia Zabi formed an elite mobile suit unit onto the front lines, the Fenrir Corps. Since Lt. Schmitzer was fluent in battle experience, he was the lead commander and mission director of the Fenrir Corps, better known as the Midnight Fenrir.[CR]You take command of Midnight Fenrir Corps in the game. Eventually, by completing missions, more pilots will join in the Fenrir Corps' long and hard fought struggle.[CR]It is the first Gundam based PlayStation 2 game that lets the player operate solely as Zeon forces</plot>

		<plot>Mobile Suit Gundam SEED: Never Ending Tomorrow (機動戦士ガンダムSEED 終わらない明日へ?) is a 2005 game from Bandai.[CR]The gameplay is largely based on Mobile Suit Gundam: Encounters in Space with significant alterations made to fit the game's universe. Unlike EIS, N.E.T. has missions for atmospheric/Earth-based environments as well as one made especially for aquatic. As a result, most mobile suits are bound by gravity though flight is still possible. Phase Shift armor is introduced which functions similarly to the anime (nullifying solid-based weaponry with a slight resistance to beam weaponry) and is represented via a purple bar underneath the HP gauge.</plot>

		<plot>Monster raising and creature contests move into the 128-bit generation as the popular Tecmo series sets up shop on the PlayStation 2 in this release of Monster Rancher 3. Though many characters and places are recognizable from earlier releases in the series, monsters in this game are represented in a cel-shaded cartoon style, similar to that of the Dreamcast's Jet Grind Radio or the contemporary PS2 release Yanya Caballista featuring Gawoo.[CR]The game receives improved graphics and some additional features with its move to the more powerful PS2 console. Most of the rules of play and monster-raising conventions established in earlier games remain in this version. Monsters develop according to the training and treatment they receive and players are encouraged to explore the game world to find new training opportunities. Players can generate monsters using other forms of media, as the game creates creatures according to data on music CDs and movie DVDs. While some aspects of creation are random, certain albums and movies may generate creatures specifically related to the artistic content on the disk.</plot>

This game also features the longest most involved storyline of any Monster Rancher game to date.[CR]Your goal is to raise monsters to win in-game tournaments, explore for items, and improve your ranch. You can also test your raising skills by battling your monsters against a friend in 2P mode.[CR]The game still uses the innovative system of having a player insert music CDs, game discs, or DVDs into the PS2 to be read and used in making monsters. If you have a good sized collection of music, games, or movies, you can have access to a large variety of monsters very fast.</plot>

		<plot>Twenty-six characters are available to play in the game, with nine making their first appearance in the series. Deception contains several new features in the series, such as chess and puzzle games with the MK characters and an online mode. The Konquest Mode role-playing game (RPG) makes a return from Deadly Alliance, but follows the life of Shujinko, a warrior who is deceived by Onaga to search for artifacts to give Onaga more powers. In November 2006, Midway released Mortal Kombat: Unchained, a port for the PlayStation Portable, which adds new characters to the game.</plot>

		<plot>MK: SM is a 3D platforming adventure beat-em-up that is based in the Mortal Kombat world. The story begins just after the first tournament, and fills in some of the backgrounds of various characters in the series. Fighting across several areas of Earthrealm, Netherrealm, and Outworld, this game follows Liu Kang and Kung Lao (the Shaolin Monks) as they thwart another invasion of Earth. MK: SM features a wide cast of recognizable characters, many secret unlockables, as well being able to play through with a friend in Ko-op mode.[CR]The combat is fast-paced, with numerous ways to dispose of enemies, including MK signature moves and Fatalities. This kombat goes beyond what you have seen in the fighting games, among the upgrades are: The series first Multi-Directional Kombat System, Multalities (kill multiple opponents with one move), Brutalities (see red as you unleash brutal force), ko-op only team-attacks, and even character progression (earn experience to spend on upgrades to moves). The backgrounds, all based on MK and MK II arenas, come to life with numerous hazards for the Monks that they can turn on their enemies.</plot>

While the preceding games in the series, Myst and Riven, were produced by Cyan Worlds and published by Brøderbund, Exile was developed by Presto Studios and published by Ubisoft. The game was released on four compact discs for both Mac OS and Microsoft Windows on May 8, 2001; versions for the Xbox and PlayStation 2 were released in late 2002.[CR]As in previous games, the player assumes the role of the Stranger, a friend of Atrus. A member of the D'ni race, Atrus can create links to other worlds called Ages by writing descriptive books. In Exile, Atrus has written an Age for the D'ni to live on while rebuilding their civilization; it is stolen, however, by a mysterious figure. The Stranger pursues the thief in an attempt to reclaim Atrus' book.[CR]The creators of the Myst franchise gave the task of creating the third Myst game to Presto Studios, known for its adventure game series The Journeyman Project. Presto sought to develop a diverse and logical approach to puzzles and Ages, and worked to make the villain sympathetically multifaceted.</plot>

		<plot>NASCAR returns with a new roster of drivers and features in NASCAR 07. The gameplay and available modes are fairly identical to the previous game (including the team racing controls), but the pace has been kicked up a notch, with an added blur effect to enhance the sense of speed. A new feature is the Adrenaline meter. When full, it offers improved handling and speed. Drivers now carry ranks with different attributes (Dynamic Driver Attributes) and racing tendencies. Specific drivers will perform better on certain tracks. Players can earn skill points to improve their attributes by keeping a lead, making clean passes, intimidation or survive dangerous situations.[CR]The main modes are Race Now, Season Mode, Chase for the Cup, Fight to the Top (Whelen Modified series, Craftsman Series, Craftsman Trucks, NBS, and NEXTEL Cup), Online Races (Quick Matches and Optimatch - where the host can fully define the event) and Dodge Challenges. The Dodge Speed Zone mode is no longer included. Important racers are shown in FMV interviews prior to Dodge Challenge races. As usual, the car can be tweaked and fine-tuned in many ways.</plot>

		<plot>NASCAR 08 is the eleventh installment of the EA Sports NASCAR series. It was developed by EA Tiburon and released for PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. This is the earliest that EA has released a NASCAR game. It also marks the first time the original Xbox has been excluded from the NASCAR lineup since NASCAR 2001.[CR]Tony Stewart is on the cover marking his third appearance on the cover of an EA Sports NASCAR game. The cover in the PAL region features Juan Pablo Montoya. NASCAR's new Car of Tomorrow as well as the current car are present in the game, although the Car of Tomorrow is generic (no separate manufacturers). ESPN's NASCAR coverage is also integrated into the game. Crew chief dialogue for the PS3 and 360 versions of the game was recorded by Chad Knaus. The Whelen Modified Tour is not included in the PS3 and 360 versions of the game, but is still present in the PS2 version.</plot>

		<plot>NASCAR 09 is the twelfth installment in the EA Sports NASCAR series, it is the sequel to 2007 game NASCAR 08. It is developed by EA Tiburon and released on the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and mobile phones in North America on June 10, 2008.[1] On March 12, 2008, EA announced Jeff Gordon as the cover athlete for NASCAR 09.[2] Through the career mode, "Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup", Gordon leads a mentoring program,[3] a new feature offered in NASCAR 09.[4] This is also the third EA Sports NASCAR video game to appear on a handheld system for Mobile phone version.[CR]In October 2007, Electronic Arts moved the PlayStation 2 game development to a new studio in North Carolina to be able to get better information with the NASCAR teams in an attempt to improve the game. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game were still made at the old studio.[5][CR]Due to the development team using certain resources to work on key features in the game, no car manufacturers were present in this year's title.[6][CR]To date, this is the last NASCAR game to be produced by EA, and the last NASCAR game for the PlayStation 2, after suffering from slumping sales, the difficulty of installing new features, and the lack of popularity. In 2009, NASCAR Kart Racing was released, replacing any 2009 installment for the annual series. It may be EA's last game before their exclusive license with NASCAR expires. Yet the door to NASCAR games for the PlayStation 2 has been shut, as Polyphony Digital's Gran Turismo 5 was not featured for the sixth-generation console.[CR]For game players in Canada, while the game was still released only in English, the instruction manual and box cover were bilingual, with text in both English and French.</plot>

		<plot>NASCAR 2005: Chase for the Cup is the eighth installment of the EA Sports' NASCAR video game series. NASCAR 2005 is the first game in the series to drop the word Thunder from the title since NASCAR 2001. Kevin Harvick, driver of the No. 29 GM Goodwrench Chevy Monte Carlo, appeared on the cover replacing Jeremy Mayfield who was originally to have been on the cover. It also marks the first time the original PlayStation has been excluded from the NASCAR lineup. This was the first NASCAR edition to be released exclusively on six generation home consoles.[CR]Unlike previous entries, which would normally add a few extra features but leave most of the game identical to its predecessor, the game brought massive change to the series. One example is the inclusion of NASCAR series other than the NASCAR Cup Series; the Busch Series (renamed the National Series to avoid an M rating from the ESRB for alcohol advertising, though the series is still referred to in-game as the Busch Series by the player's agent and Bill Weber), the Craftsman Truck Series, and the Featherlite Modified Series, plus production cars and the Daytona Prototypes of the Rolex Sports Car Series. More examples include the implementation of NASCAR's new Chase for the Cup points system, and Fight to the Top mode, where the player controls a custom driver throughout his career starting in the lower series and working up the ladder (similar to NASCAR: Dirt to Daytona). Another change is the absence of the cockpit view and the absence of makes and models in the Truck series, all of which appear to be Ford F-150s. Also due to failed negotiations with licensing Pocono Raceway is not included. The score is composed by David Robidoux</plot>

		<plot>NASCAR Thunder 2002 is a racing simulator video game developed by EA Tiburon and published by EA Sports that came out for the Sony PlayStation, Sony PlayStation 2, and Xbox. The theme song for the game is "Sweet Home Alabama" by Lynyrd Skynyrd. It is the fifth game in the NASCAR series of video games, and is the first of the series to have a new title (the other games simply read "NASCAR", followed by the year). Notably, it is the first NASCAR game to feature alternate paint schemes on the cars. It featured the 2001 Cup Series Champion Jeff Gordon on its cover and 2000 Cup Series Champion Bobby Labonte on the disc.[CR]NASCAR Thunder 2002[CR]Nascar2002.png[CR]NASCAR 2002 cover art[CR]Developer(s) EA Tiburon[CR]Publisher(s) Electronic Arts[CR]Series NASCAR Thunder[CR]Engine enhanced NASCAR Thunder engine[CR]Platform(s) Xbox, PlayStation, PlayStation 2[CR]Release PlayStation[CR]NA: October 1, 2001[CR]PlayStation 2[CR]NA: October 15, 2001[CR]Xbox[CR]NA: November 15, 2001[CR]Genre(s) Racing[CR]Mode(s) Single-player, Multiplayer[CR]NASCAR Thunder 2002 was the first NASCAR game released for the Xbox and the second released for the PlayStation 2. Game modes consist of Create-a-car, Quick race, Season mode, Career mode, and practice. Before every race, the player has the option to qualify for a position at the start of the race, get to know the track in practice, or 'race' other cars in Happy Hour. The game has 35 drivers from the 2001 Winston Cup season (minus Dale Earnhardt due to his death, but the game has many tributes to him including a black No. 3 screen on start-up) and several then-Busch Series and fantasy drivers that can be unlocked.[1][CR]The PlayStation version was separate from the PS2 and Xbox versions, included only 36 drivers, and included an instant-replay feature, fantasy tracks, and only 18 drivers per race, and all of the alternate paint schemes were removed. A system of power-up/cheat cards and challenges, similar to Chase/Thunder plates and Lightning/Dodge Challenges in later editions, was a major game mode in this version.</plot>

Completing these tasks can unlock certain accessories that they can use for their created character, showing off their status. Players can also associate with various teammates and coaches, how they act towards these characters will determine their place with the team (being a team player and helping out others will have the coaches play you more and have create a bigger fan base and being a individual loner will alienate them from the team and have a smaller fan base).[CR]The obligatory game modes also exist in this version as well (Franchise, Exhibition) as well as updated NBA rosters with every NBA team available. The Havok engine is introduced for this version, giving the game a more realistic feel when combined with new animations and enhanced character models.[CR]NBA Replay also returns, letting players relive classic moments from the 07/08 as well as partake in the 08/09 season by downloading them off of the Playstation Network (five each week during the season). Players can also upload and share data, show off their created superstars and track their progress through leaderboards and even play against each other in online exhibition games.[CR]Audio commentary is provided by Seattle Supersonics star Kevin Calabro and franchise newcomer Kenny "The Jet" Smith.</plot>

The player can dunk, pass, play in the post, run plays, call timeouts, and blocks shots (etc.). The game features many visual and presentation elements that help improve the realism; the game includes commentary, crowd animations, lighting effects, sound effects, and other small details. Kevin Harlan is the play-by-play commentator, Kenny Smith is the colour commentator, and Craig Sager is the sideline reporter.[2]</plot>

		<plot>The story mode feature in NBA Ballers: Phenom is the games main feature. The player creates a custom character and can choose from a variety of customizations such as height, age, body type, position and more. The story is built around the created player, the Phenom, and his rivalry with former friend Philip "Hot Sauce" Champion. After Hot Sauce convinces the scouts that he and you are indeed a one-man show, Hot Sauce being the one man. Not only does he steal your glory but he steals your girlfriend too. It's NBA Finals week and you are setting out to prove just how good you are. With the million dollars and NBA's number 1 draft position or a lucrative entrepreneur empire up for offer, you must do whatever it takes to become the best. The main games are played in Tournament style the same as NBA Ballers. There are 4 locations in which you can compete in Tournaments. You can go back to your hotel when you are not competing in an event, where you can save the game, exit the game, continue the game, modify your baller and design your mansion. Two of the locations (Beverly Hills and Venice Beach) are explorable. You can walk around the town doing numerous tasks such as collecting the hidden diamonds, play Peja's Hot Hoops and you can talk to certain people and do tasks for them resulting in a generous reward and there is even a ticket stand where you can buy tickets to participate in certain events such as the Freestyle Rap Battle with Jin.[CR]GAMEPLAY[CR]The normal 1-on-1 half court gameplay was kept intact from the previous game. However, Phenom introduces 2-on-2 mode, which somewhat mimics the gameplay of NBA Jam as games are played on a full court with two ballers on both teams.</plot>

		<plot>Rather than 5 on 5 action like professional play, this game features 3 on 3 play. Using players from the NBA, each player chooses a guard, forward, and center from the team's NBA roster for the first half and can make substitutions for the second half.[CR]NBA Hoopz is an arcade-style game and not meant to be realistic: players can jump twenty or thirty feet in the air, dunk the ball from 20 feet (6.1 m) away, and do otherwise physically impossible things. Fouls are only called on flagrant pushes, foul shots are rare (and only after a number of fouls are accumulated), and there is no out of bounds. In addition, after a player makes three consecutive shots he becomes "on fire" which allows him to make almost any shot as well as goaltend without penalty. The PlayStation 2 and Dreamcast versions accommodate up to four players.</plot>

		<plot>NBA Shootout 2004 lets you play either a full season or exhibition matches of fully licensed NBA basketball with your favorite teams and players. Fully textured 3d players with faces of the top NBA players are mapped into the game. Listen to commentary by Ian Eagle and Bill Walton as they call the games right as you play. While there is no franchise mode like other more traditional sports games, there is a career mode where you create a character who tries to make his way up through the summer leagues and the NBDL. You'll be given challenges that you'll need to meet so that you can ultimately make your way to the NBA and get an actual contract to join a NBA team. Once in the NBA, you'll need to work even harder to win championships and titles so you can eventually be inducted into the NBA Hall of Fame. You can also unlock the 50 greatest players of all time by completing challenges in exhibition games like scoring a certain number of points or using a certain person to get a number of assists. Use a USB microphone to give your teammates commands to help. Give them commands on offense or defense about where to move so you can use your teammates effectively.</plot>

		<plot>NCAA Football was an American football video game series developed by EA Sports in which players control and compete against current Division I FBS college teams. The series is a younger brother to the Madden NFL series.[CR]In July 2013, the NCAA announced that it would not renew its licensing contract with Electronic Arts because of an ongoing legal dispute regarding the use of player likenesses in the games. However, this contract only covers the use of the NCAA name and related logos, not those of individual schools and conferences, which are negotiated individually or through the Collegiate Licensing Company. The CLC concurrently announced that it would extend its existing licensing deal with EA through 2017, ensuring that EA Sports could continue the series without the NCAA branding.[1] However, the series was placed on hiatus in September 2013, following three major conferences pulling their trademark licenses from EA, and uncertainties surrounding the results of lawsuits involving the use of player likenesses in-game. However, EA Sports is still making an attempt to get the series back going.[2]</plot>

		<plot>The NCAA Basketball (formerly NCAA March Madness) series was a College basketball game which was published by EA Sports from 1998 until 2009. After EA Sports' rival publisher 2K Sports cancelled its own college basketball game, College Hoops, in 2008, EA changed the name of the series from NCAA March Madness to NCAA College Basketball. The series was discontinued on February 10, 2010.[1][CR]Like other games based on NCAA sports, it could not feature the players' names (as that is against NCAA policy/rules), so only the players' numbers were used in the rosters. Users were able to edit the rosters, putting in the correct names for each team if they wished to do so. Many player last names were built into the in-game commentary, like in the NBA Live series.[CR]Verne Lundquist, Brad Nessler, and Gus Johnson lent their voices for play-by-play in the games at various times. Lundquist was the original announcer, with Nessler taking over in the mid-2000s and Johnson joining him for the most recent game in the series. Bill Raftery and Dick Vitale were analysts. Raftery originally worked with Lundquist on their games and returned to work alongside Johnson for CBS-branded games in NCAA Basketball 10, while Vitale and Nessler joined the series at the same time.</plot>

The general manager mode has also been changed, mostly to help you with the draft so you can easily see what areas of your team need improvement.</plot>

		<plot>Play a full season with your favorite team or try the franchise mode and build a legacy. You can even create teams and players.[CR]In general manager mode, when you go into the off-season, several different things happen. First, you'll see a list of players who have retired from your team and the reasons they've left, which are usually related to injuries or diminishing skills. If you lose some key players, then you'll need to make every effort to ensure that those positions are filled by free agents with similar skills or rookies who have solid potential. You're frequently stuck with trying your luck in the draft, where you can select a rookie based on how you finished the season, like in the real NFL draft. GameDay has a feature that gives you a breakdown on the draft and provides you with an overall rating for each rookie. Following the draft, you have to sign your rookies with whatever cap money you've set aside for that purpose. When you're all done, it's time to start the next season.</plot>

		<plot>New rules and updated rosters and season schedules feature in this update of the longrunning NHL series, as do many new features.[CR]Deking is now performed using the left analog stick, with swift signature moves of star players that confuse opponents and reward skill. The same stick is used to increase the accuracy when shooting. While preparing for a shot, a bull's-eye appears in the enemy goal and you can quickly move the target to the corners for precision. To add to the individual qualities, statistics such as speed and size are now reflected during gameplay in the players' momentum and turning radius. To get past opponents quickly, you can generate momentum for quick speed boosts.[CR]With the introduction of R.P.M. (Realistic Puck Momentum) dynamics, there is more randomness with the puck, as a shot off the mask can now stun goalies. Another small addition is the deformation of the ice during the match. In the player creation mode, where you can now apply bruises, broken noses, black eyes and scars to your players, the thumbstick is used for "face sculpting" - changing the different features.[CR]All the regular game modes are present, of which the Dynasty Mode from the previous version is the most complete, with scouting and full management options, inside and outside the arena. Contrary to the last game, you can now intervene during simulated AI games and win the match for your team.[CR]The PC, PS2 and Xbox version support online multiplayer games, and as a special bonus, the original NHL 94 game, one of the first in the series, has been included with the PS2 edition.</plot>

		<plot>This game uses the same three-on-three style that debuted in Hitz 2002. The 2003 installment has larger rinks, bigger crowds, a referee, and animated coaches. All 30 NHL teams are represented with motion-capture animation, and you can build your own players with the Create-Player option. The game's Season mode now allows for trades, stat tracking, and player awards.[CR]Up to four players can play each other in exhibition mode. Season mode puts you into a standard NHL schedule, but you can change to a shorter season if you want. There is also a small numer of hockey-related minigames, such as keep-away. Franchise mode is where you pick and name your team, name your players, and play against other teams to earn experience points. Those points can be used to upgrade your players in categories such as toughness, speed, passing, and agility. After beating all the lesser teams in a tier, you can move on to battle a "boss team" for that region. Beating that team nets you some new equipment for your players, which also improves their stats.</plot>

		<plot>NHL Hitz Pro is an ice hockey video game developed by Next Level Games and published by Midway Games. It's the third and final game of the NHL Hitz series. It was released on September 25, 2003, for the PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube, and Xbox. Unlike the previous titles in the series, this game has 5-on-5 gameplay instead of the usual 3-on-3 gameplay with the earlier titles. Despite that fact, however, the game does not include penalty shots, and it is still an arcade-type hockey game like its predecessors. It also has, as the name suggests, a lot of hard hitting, appealing more often to casual hockey fans than hardcore ones. The cover athlete of the game is Nicklas Lidström, and features commentary from Tim Kitzrow[1] and Harry Teinowitz.[CR]Unlike many other hockey video games of the 21st century, NHL Hitz Pro had the IIHF license, enabling it to use the jerseys of the Olympic hockey teams.[CR]The game also has many game modes, one of the most popular being the "Pick-Up Hockey" game mode, where the game would turn into either a roller, street, or pond hockey match-up between two amateur teams.</plot>

Both are led by Narcotics chief Joe Kowalski (voiced by Ron Pearlman), and the player switches between the two as the story unfolds.[CR]As an undercover cop, players are free to roam the streets and dispense justice at their discretion. Aside from storyline missions, players can encounter 12 types of randomized street crimes and stop them to boost their "badge rating" (loosely, a measure of their trust within the police). Players can likewise flash their badge around to cause perps to surrender or run. Criminals that resist must be beaten in a small "struggle" minigame to get cuffed. Players can also arrest alleyway drug dealers and deposit their drugs safely at the station.[CR]Alternatively, the player can beat up drug dealers for their cash and stash, then sell the drugs to civilians for income. The player can also use the drugs themselves for temporary beneficial effects (ecstasy keeps enemies from attacking, speed makes you run and shoot faster, etc.) at the cost of badge points and the potential to become addicted. Excessive use of force against innocent civilians, or selling drugs to other undercover cops, result in major losses of badge points.</plot>

		<plot>Based off Masashi Kishimoto's manga and anime Naruto, Ultimate Ninja is the first installment of the Ultimate Ninja series, known in Japan as the Narutimate Hero series. It is a fighting game with cel-shaded graphics resembling figures straight out of the manga. Ultimate Ninja contains twelve characters from the show, each with their own unique movesets and special attacks. In the overseas versions, two more bonus characters were added: Curse Mark Sasuke and Nine-Tailed Naruto. These were already playable in the Japanese version as a stronger mode for the regular characters, but split off into separate characters for the other versions. As such, the base characters cannot transform into these variations in the versions released outside of Japan.[CR]The characters can fight in several locations seen in the show and comics, such as Hidden Leaf Village, the Chunin Exam arena, and the Forest of Death. There is a main story mode with six battles and dialogue between the characters.</plot>

		<plot>Based on the anime, this fighting game lets players explore the ninja village of Konoha to navigate, speak to various characters and set up mini-games and battles. In keeping with the tradition of the series, an exclusive and original story will have players exploring the massive 3D rendered Hidden Leaf Village, participating in battle royale matches and completing more than 55 missions. The unparalleled experience doesn't stop there as tons of unlockable content will be available to offer loads of replay value including movies, music and cards.[CR]Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 3 makes monumental leaps in the franchise with a host of "firsts" for the series. Players can now live through and be a part of all the major events that defined Story Arc 1 in Heroes History mode. Also, ninja-in-training can customize their characters with the Ultimate Jutsu which gives them that extra bit of edge during battle and allows them to earn points towards upgrading their strength, defense, chakra, agility and other special abilities. Turn playable characters into more powerful ninja of unprecedented size or summon giant creatures as allies with the new Summoning mode.</plot>

		<plot>Naruto: Uzumaki Chronicles is a completely new story from the world of Naruto, known from the animated TV series. Many incidents have been happening lately around Leaf Village. It appears that Orochimaru is planning to destroying the Leaf Village and it is up to Naruto and The Gang to stop him. This is the first PS2 Naruto game rendered in a 3D environment (no longer cel-shaded) with genuine CGI cutscenes.[CR]This Naruto game plays differently than the previous two PS2 fighting-based games because you have the option to roam freely and practice your skills before taking up the mission-based storyline. You can perform your basic melee combos and power strikes, as well as jutsu moves using chakra like sexy jutsu and shadow replication to name a few. Naruto can also transform into Nine-Tails Naruto when his health drops below a certain level. You can increase your health, stamina, chakra levels or learn new skills by purchasing them using "virtue points" earned by winning battles. You also gain allies to help you in battles, like Sasuke, Kakashi and Chouji.</plot>

		<plot>Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja 4 is the first game in the series that moves into the Shippuden storyline. The newly added "Master Mode" tells an original story that takes place during Naruto's journey with Jiraiya and is centered around a demon named Black Shadow who demands human sacrifices from a nearby village. After this is resolved the mode continues with Shippuden's regular Kazekage story arc.[CR]The "Master Mode" features a small but open game world for the player to explore. Naruto can collect items, fight enemies and talk to people in order to progress. However, the actual fighting remains to be the core of the Ultimate Ninja experience and was more refined and expanded in Ultimate Ninja 4. When two opponents clash, they will begin a series of high-speed attacks, appearing as a pair of blurs flashing across the stage. The winner is determined by a game similar to that of Rock, Paper, Scissors. There is also the addition of "Awakening Jutsu", a technique that is more powerful than the standard Ultimate Jutsu and, as the name implies, "awakens" a character's hidden powers and can only be used when certain conditions are met.</plot>

		<plot>The game is a one-player simulation of naval combat, in which the player commands an individual ship. In the opening cutscene, a World War II-era destroyer is caught in a dimension-warping vortex and transported to a parallel universe where the technology level is the same (although science-fiction weapons such as rail guns are available), but the world is at war between two main factions, the Empire and the Freedom Forces. The first mission of the game revolves around navigating a destroyer to safety while being bombarded by unidentified ships. Upon rendezvous with friendly forces, later identified as the Freedom Forces, the crew decides to join them in the war against the Empire.</plot>

		<plot>The gameplay is based upon rival street racing crews. Players run a crew and can hire specific street racers to be in their crew and the active friendly racer is known as a wingman. Each hirable street racer has two skills, one which is a racing skill (scout, blocker, and drafter) and a non-race skill (fixer, mechanic, and fabricator). Each skill has different properties from finding hidden alleys/back streets (shortcuts) to reducing police attention. Cars driven by the wingmen are also different; blockers drive muscles, drafters drive exotics and scouts drive tuners (although the first two unlockable wingmen (Neville and Sal) drive cars according to the player's chosen car class at the start of the game). In career mode, players have to race tracks and win to conquer territories and face off against bosses to conquer districts.</plot>

		<plot>The Need for Speed series returns, this time reverting back to the 'chase' arcade experience instead of a racing simulation. Top speed racing is the name of the game, where you must outchase not just the opposing drivers, but the cops.[CR]Choose from a selection of today's (and yesterday's) top sports cars, including the Ferrari F50, Porsche 911 and a range from the likes of Ford, Corvette, BMW, Lotus, Mercedes, Aston Martin, the McLaren F1 and a lot more.[CR]The competitive race mode allows you to take on other drivers and beat them to the line. A selection of tracks allows you to not only dodge incoming traffic, but perform deadly jumps and stunts to receive points. These points, combined with the points recieved from your finishing position, can unlock new cars and tracks.[CR]The Hot Pursuit mode combines all the major elements of the competitive mode with the chance to out run the cops. They will throw everything at you to try and stop you, including running you off the road, setting up road blocks and unleashing an attack helicopter equiped with missiles. Three busts by the cops ends the race.</plot>

		<plot>Need for Speed Undercover has players racing through speedways, dodging cops and chasing rivals as they go deep undercover to take down an International crime syndicate. The game heralds the return of high-intensity police chases and introduces the all-new 'Heroic Driving Engine' -- a unique technology that generates incredible high-performance moves at 180 miles per hour during breathtaking highway battles. A mix of computer graphics and live-action movies immerses gamers in the rich world of the Tri-City Bay Area. The city’s open-world environment features over 80 miles of roads, including an enormous highway system that sets the stage for highway battles. These high-speed, high-stake chase sequences push players to the limit as they fight off cops and opponents while whipping through traffic at 180 miles per hour. An intelligent new A.I. mechanic delivers a realistic and high-energy action driving experience. Going back to the franchise’s roots, Need for Speed Undercover features more aggressive and intelligent cops whose sole purpose is to take down the player quickly and by any means necessary. Need for Speed Undercover also features the series' signature car customization, real-world damage and realistic driving physics. The game includes some of the hottest licensed cars such as the Audi R8, BMW M6 and Lexus IS-F.</plot>

		<plot>Need For Speed Underground 2 takes place in Bayview after the events of Need for Speed: Underground. The prologue begins with the player driving in a Nissan Skyline R34 in Olympic City (though the racing scenes are actually in Bayview), the setting of NFS:UG. He then receives a race challenge from a rather ominous personality who offers him a spot on his crew, but "won't take 'no' for an answer." The player races off — despite Samantha's warnings — only to be ambushed by a mysterious driver in a rage that totals his Skyline. The driver, who has a unique scythe tattoo, makes a call confirming the accident, and the flashback fades out.</plot>

By switching between the two at any time, players can use Tor's up-close melee attacks or cause damage from afar with Roberta's spells. This game stays faithful to the traditional third-person action-adventure. Magical items and weapons gained along the way will develop the characters' abilities and strengths. In particular, elementally-aligned motes can be attached to weapons and armor as a combat bonus. There are many puzzles and side-quests along the way, and players will fight evil Neopets.</plot>

		<plot>In the home console versions of the game, the city of Bikini Bottom is producing an anniversary show of The New Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy in which the titular SpongeBob wishes to play as the starring role.[2] SpongeBob must compete with the other characters in the series – including Patrick Star, Sandy Cheeks, Squidward Tentacles, Mr. Krabs, and Sheldon J. Plankton – in order to impress the talent scouts and land the lead role of the villain.[3][CR]The game includes 30 unique minigames (referred to as "auditions") that have different play style and objectives, though the common goal is to get the highest points. Each minigame is based on an area or location in Bikini Bottom. Every location has three minigames with it. There are a total of 8 locations for a total of 24 minigames that are played through story mode. The other six are optional unlockables. Examples of the minigames include a driving test, whose goal is to finish the first through three driving courses; a jailbreak, whose goal is to free as many prison inmates as possible without getting caught; and a rhythm minigame, whose goal is to match the short and long musical notes that travel toward a marker. There are two types of minigames: the free-for-all type, where the player competes against the three other characters, and the 2 vs. 2 type, where the player teams up with the first computer-controlled character that the player chooses (or the second player) against the other two computer-controlled characters.[CR]The game features six playable characters: SpongeBob SquarePants, Squidward Tentacles, Sandy Cheeks, Plankton, Patrick Star, and Mr. Krabs. Before the player can play a minigame, a character must be chosen, as well as three (or two in 2-player mode) CPU characters. All characters are available from the start and have equal abilities; they have no advantage over each other. However, the player can adjust the difficulty to control the character in three different options (Easy, Med, Hard) as well as setting the computer characters' artificial intelligence in three options (Silly, Norm, Smart).</plot>

		<plot>The gameplay is almost identical to the original Tak Game, whereas Tak's weapon is always on hand and mana is represented by feather count and not a meter. The game takes place in various locations, such as tropical forests, canyons, volcanic areas, snowy tundras and other harsh environments. There are also a number of dimensional stages, in the Dreamworld. Tak gets aid from animals, a number of which did not appear in the first game. In this game, Tak's juju magic is triggered by holding down one button and pressing combos of other buttons. Tak also earns juju powers gradually throughout the game instead of having to seek them out.</plot>

		<plot>The Nakatomi company is searching for the pieces of the Akujiki sword, shattered by Hotsuma in the prequel, Shinobi. Luckily, the Oboro ninja clan has since reformed. As Hibana, kunoichi (female ninja) of the Oboro clan, you are charged with the task of finding the pieces of the Akujiki before Nakatomi does.[CR]Nightshade is a sequel to Overworks' Shinobi for the PS2. Like its predecessor, it features several levels full of challenging enemies to fight using a combination of your sword, shuriken, and magic scrolls. Speed and stealth remain the emphasis, as you use stealth dashes and the ability to walk on walls to perform long strings of kills called tates. One of the main improvements to the gameplay system is the ability to create much larger combos/tates. In order to facilitate this, they've expanded the battle system to include flying kicks to break your opponent's guard and stealth attacks to kill unsuspecting foes in a single blow.</plot>

		<plot>Nobunaga's Ambition: Iron Triangle is another entry in KOEI's long-running series of grand strategy games. As in the previous instalments, the player assumes the role of a Japanese feudal lord during the famous Sengoku period (from the XV to the XVII century).[CR]The main game screen shows an overhead 3D rendered view of the landscape, showing buildings and moving armies belonging to each clan. The player gives orders using a menu with a list of commands, that branch out with several options: City (to construct buildings), Personnel (to employ officers), Military (to move and attack with the army), Strategy, Diplomacy (to negotiate treaties and exchange technology) and others to review the resources. The game is paused while issuing the orders, and they are only executed when in Active mode, where time passes and seasons change.[CR]The different seasons have an impact on certain resources and activities, like harvesting and drafting. The scheduled actions and rank position of the clans can be reviewed at any time, on a separate screen. The game has several scenarios and special modes, with historical notes coming up when the game time synchronizes with some major events in Japan's timeline.</plot>

One group of brave teens decides to find out what's going on... no matter what. They have no idea what kind of horrors have gripped the school and everyone in it. In the darkness, the evil has power... but add light and they can be defeated. Will they survive the night ahead?[CR]In Solo Mode, choose from 5 characters with different personalities, aptitude and perspectives. Change between them at any time (as long as they are still alive).[CR]The player can also select a second person (as a "teammate") to accompany the player by going to a "gathering point" in the game. At any time during play, the player can switch control between the first character and the second, thereby accessing their special talents.[CR]There are several basic types of weapons used in the game: contact (a baseball bat for instance), pistols, guns, and more exotic, high-powered "special" weapons. Ammunition is specific for each gun or pistol and is not interchangeable. Weapons can be swapped between characters and ammunition found is stored in the group's reserves for sharing amongst them.[CR]The player will also be gathering up first-aid kits, discs (for saving games), keys, screwdrivers and other tools. Other objects are required for solving riddles within the game.</plot>

		<plot>The nations of Erion had always held an uneasy peace, as the various kings and queens watched each other for any signs of weakness. When the country of Valentine is obliterated by the power of an ancient artifact, it sparks a bloody war between the fairies of Ringford and the warriors of Ragnanival. Little do they know that they are acting out an almost-forgotten prophecy: one that, if fulfilled, will lead to the destruction of the entire world. Take control of the warrior princess Gwendolyn, daughter of Odin, and follow the threads of an intricately woven story as you uncover the truth behind the prophecy - and how to bring it to an end. Five playable characters in all; each one's fate is intertwined with the others'. A robust cooking and alchemy system that can be used to create powerful attack and recovery items.</plot>

		<plot>Conquer your demons and you may conquer the world in this distinctly styled role-playing adventure for the PlayStation 2. Some have compared the look of this game to Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas and the fluid, stop-motion appearance of the three-dimensional characters is not completely unlike that seen in seasonal television specials. OKAGE: Shadow King is not a holiday story, however, but a dark tale of polar opposites that questions basic notions of identity and essence.[CR]Players take the role of Ari, a young man with a remarkable affliction. A powerful demon -- calling himself "Stan" -- has taken refuge in Ari's shadow and is becoming infused in the boy's life. To free both his demon and himself, Ari embarks on a dangerous and involved quest to rid the world of seven other rival demons. Though he suffers under the burden of playing host to Stan, Ari is also aided from time to time by his demon's powers and the two begin to forge a symbiotic relationship.</plot>

		<plot>It's 2032. The planet is now ruled by the World Coalition Government which annexed 80% of the countries, with the remaining quickly dragged into the WCG. While their official goal was to solve humankind's problems, it was about money. Massive spending bankrupted poorer countries, and soon all traces of individual government disappeared. For those who were poor, the situation didn't improved one bit, and for the richer, maintaining the status was done at the expense of their privacy and personal freedoms. To make things worse, life outside the major cities, far from the atmosphere processors is nearly impossible, as the so-called "Wilderness Preserves" are poisoned, and those who venture into them risk a painful death.[CR]Konoko, fresh out from TCTF (Technology Crimes Task Force, a secret police to take cyber drugs and weapons from the streets, as well as explore the induced technophobia to operate and investigate on a blank check permission) academy is placed under the command of Terrance Griffin and Dr. Kerr and linked to a SLD - an android - called Shinatama, who is neurally linked to her. However, Konoko knows next to nothing about her past, other that she was orphaned at the age of three and felt "different" to other people while was being brought up under the wing of TCTF. After many years in training, she has finally the chance to prove herself to Griffin and the TCTF, and so, heads for a warehouse rumoured to be under the control of the Syndicate, a criminal organization which grew exponentially after a young man called "Boss Muro" climbed to the top of the organization.</plot>

		<plot>Ten years after the lone swordsman, Samanosuke, rose up against an army of demon warriors, Nobunaga's evil campaign continues to wreak havoc across feudal Japan. A young warrior, Jubei, returns home to find his remote and once vibrant village in ruins, destroyed by Nobunaga's minions. With vengeance in his heart, Jubei launches upon an epic and magical quest, which will reveal his ultimate destiny.[CR]Like Samanoske before him, Jubei can absorb the souls of defeated monsters to strengthen his weapons and armor. Monsters can be defeated either by attacking them until their health is depleted, or by striking them at the very instant before they hit Jubei. This will make Jubei preform an Issen attack which destroys in a single blow. Jubei can find or buy treasures in the first half of the game, and give these to companions he meets, befriending them. Based on who Jubei befriends the events of the game will change.</plot>

		<plot>Like its predecessors, OutRun 2006 is an old-school arcade racer, which means that your cars don't have realistic physics, don't get damaged and have insanely fast speed.[CR]Since this title is officially licensed by Ferrari, you drive with 15 original models from the DINO 246 GTS over the F430 to the all-new Enzo Ferrari. The heart of the game is the Coast 2 Coast mode in which you race against up to 5 AI players on 15 US themed tracks. In addition you have to impress different girlfriends. She tells you what she wants to see (a hard slide around a curve or a close take-over for example) and you have to perform it to win her heart.[CR]There are 3 other game modes available in singleplayer: OutRun, Time Attack and OutRun2SP. In OutRun2SP you get access to 15 arcade tracks from the original OutRun 2. In OutRun however you need to drive your girlfriend through various checkpoints to the goal before the timer hits zero. In Time Attack you just have to beat the highscore of the current track. You can either race against the clock or against ghost cars.[CR]In every mode you get OutRun miles after the race. These are the currency of the game and are needed to unlock new cars, upgrades and additional music-stations.[CR]If you feel alone, even with your virtual girlfriend in the car, you can race online against 5 other players.</plot>

It learns counter attacks that target your weaknesses and look to exploit any repetitive tactics players use. Defenders react better to danger, closing down the ball and charging at shots and the goalkeepers hold shots that are closer to them as well. Teammates make more intelligent runs into space and the close control has been sharpened to ensure quick and fluid passing and speedy attacks can be built. The next gen versions also feature extensive edit modes so players can completely customise their PES 2008 experience.</plot>

		<plot>PaRappa the Rapper 2 (パラッパラッパー2 Parappa Rappā Tsu?) is a PlayStation 2 rhythm video game and the sequel to PaRappa the Rapper, it is the third game in the series following UmJammer Lammy. Though the game boasts a number of new gameplay elements, it was not as well-received critically and failed to garner similar sales numbers as its predecessor.[CR]The game plays similar to its predecessor and features 8 stages. The teacher will give a line of rap and PaRappa will have to repeat it, or otherwise improvise it. If he messes up his line twice in a row, he drops a rank from Good, to Bad, to Awful. Performing well two times in a row will bring the player up a rank. Players lose the level if they drop below Awful, or finish the level in the Bad or Awful state. Parappa 2 handles this a little differently from its predecessors, as upon dropping a rank, the teacher will say 'Getting Worse', and the song will go back two lines, and sometimes altering the lines to make them easier to play. If the player improvises a rap successfully two times in a row, it accesses Cool mode, where the teacher leaves PaRappa to do freestyle by himself. If PaRappa can reach the end of the level in Cool mode, he'll earn a Cool ranking for that stage. This unlocks music tracks available to listen in a music player available at the end of the game.[CR]Between every two levels (except for level 8), there is a minigame in which 'Kotamanegis' (little onions) from Chop Chop Master Onion's dojo hold up plates for PaRappa to break. Hitting the plates earns PaRappa extra points to add to his previous level's score, while hitting the Tamanegis when they are not ready deducts points.[CR]When a level is completed, a versus mode is unlocked, playable with a friend or against the computer. In this mode, the two players are given a line to rap, and each player must try and improvise to get a higher score than the previous one. Beating their opponent earns a point, and three points win the game.[CR]Upon completing the game, Parappa's hat changes color to represent an increase in the stage's difficulty, going from Blue, to Pink to Yellow. When playing through the game again, the lines are remixed. Completing the game in Cool Mode unlocks a music player where you can listen to any level with a Cool Rating on, along with the full version of the Stage 8 Intro song "Come a Long Way", while completing the Vs. CPU mode on all difficulty levels unlocks the final song, "Say "I Gotta Believe!"", performed by De La Soul featuring Double. The player can change his hat color on the title screen by rotating the analogue stick, but the line changes will remain, meaning the player will have to start a new game from scratch in order to play the songs in the original layout.</plot>

		<plot>Long ago, back in medieval times, an evil spirit known as Spooky had terrorized all of Pac-Land. In response to this, the great Wizard Pac created a potion that turned 5 ordinary fruit into the "Golden Fruit." A young knight called Sir Pac-alot fought and sealed Spooky underneath a large tree using the Golden Fruit, which were attached to the branches of the tree. In the present time late at night, Inky, Pinky, Blinky and Clyde sneak into the village and, in their mischief, pick the Golden Fruit off the tree in the center of town. Unfortunately, this has released Spooky from his prison. Spooky tells the ghosts to take the Golden Fruit and follow him if they wish to rid the land of the Pac-people forever. When Pac-Man awakes, he hears the news from Professor Pac about the Golden Fruit and Spooky, and sets off to defeat the ghosts and Spooky.</plot>

		<plot>Phantom Brave is a strategy RPG which takes place in the world of Ivoire. Ivoire consists of vast seas and numerous islands; it used to be a peaceful place, but an ancient (and powerful) force is now threatening life in the various lands. The character you control in the game is Marona, a 13 year old orphaned girl. Marona has the ability to communicate with phantoms, an ability that brings a lot of resentment from other people but will help her to head out into the world and solve the problems that are occurring. A phantom known as Ash acts as Marona's guardian; as the game progresses, other phantoms will join your party, each of which have different capabilities.[CR]The game features a turn based combat system. During battles, Marona is able to attack enemies by herself, and she can also summon phantoms in her party to help out. To summon phantoms, you will need to confine them to an object on the screen (such as a rock or tree). Once confined to an object, you will then be able to control the phantom in battle, though phantoms only remain controllable for a limited number of turns. The object you confine a phantom to will affect it's abilities; for example, a rock may make a phantom stronger but move slower. By defeating enemies in battle you earn experience points allowing to level up and become more powerful.</plot>

		<plot>Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection faithfully recreates eight of the most memorable tables from the golden age of pinball in photorealistic 3D. Working closely with Williams to ensure authenticity of each of the games, the collection is highlighted by some of the most popular and innovative Williams pinball tables, including Gorgar, the first-ever talking pinball machine, Black Knight, which introduced "Magna-Save" and Bonus Ball, and Space Shuttle, which took the pinball industry by storm in 1984. Every table has been meticulously recreated to bring players the visuals, sound effects and gameplay that made these games legendary successes. Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection harkens back to the arcades of the 1980s. Players begin Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection with access to four pinball tables, and the remaining four tables are unlocked as the game progresses. Players can spend as little as two minutes on a quick pinball challenge, or delve deeper into the game, gaining rewards in a token-based system as they unlock each of the pinball tables. Single-player Arcade and Challenge modes provide hours of solo entertainment, and a Multiplayer mode lets players face each other head-on.</plot>

Alfonso's retired, but he's called in his kids Junior and Fawcett to fix up the island, and maybe learn a few things about plumbing along the way.[CR]Gameplay is similar to the classic Pipe Dream/Pipe Mania, but with a more mission-based structure, and more unusual modes. Missions can be replayed to get a higher grade, and high grades can unlock various treasures, such as movies, character bios, and new game modes. Pipe Mania even has a multiplayer mode; compete against a friend for points, or use your attacks to damage your opponent's pipes.</plot>

		<rom name="ps2-redump-usa-chd-part-P/Pirates - The Legend of Black Kat (USA).chd" size="2191825981"/>
		<plot>More an action-adventure game than a straight naval sim, Pirates: The Legend of Black Kat is designed to offer PS2 and Xbox gamers the chance to live the free but dangerous life of a true pirate. Players will explore five strange new lands that hold unimagined treasures for those brave and skilled enough to claim them. Battle and conquest are also important ingredients in a pirate's lifestyle and combat takes place both on land and on the high seas. The player's character is quick with a sword and can increase her swashbuckling skills with experience. [CR]Similarly, wealth gained from adventure and victory allows the pirate to upgrade to larger ships with more deadly weaponry. A dozen unique fighting vessels will become available to skilled captains, along with special accoutrements that afford the ships extra powers. Sea battles involve a realistic combination of positioning and timing, as tall ships align themselves to fire on enemy vessels from port- and starboard-mounted weapons and time must be spent reloading the powerful cannons and guns after each shot. The ability to repair damage on the fly is also an important strategic consideration in ship-to-ship fights.[CR]Though the gameplay of this 3D adventure is oriented towards fast action, several elements of role-playing are also incorporated, to move the story along and involve the player more deeply. The lead character Katarina de Leon plots a thoughtful course for her career on the open seas. The "Black Kat" sets sail to uncover mysteries and position herself in circumstances that will increase her overall status among other pirates, securing a position of power. In addition to Katarina's well-developed storyline, the game's "Captain vs. Captain" battle mode allows a more combat-intensive, freeform style of play.[CR]Pirates ? The Legend of Black Kat, formerly known as Pirates of Skull Cove, is Westwood's next-generation pirate game with epic ship battles and thrilling swordplay, starring Black Kat. Take to take to the high seas as Black Kat and master a dozen pirate ships from the simple gunboat to the massive power of a man o' war. Discover and explore increasingly dangerous and fantastic island worlds and develop Black Kat's swordplay skills to master the dagger, cutlass and saber to defeat evil pirate bands and loot their treasures.</plot>

Other features include a player-controlled upgrade system, along with a diverse set of sword fighting and grappling moves. Puzzles in the form of mini-games can be found throughout the game's 20+ levels.</plot>

		<plot>The game begins in large urban area. The night is young and a heat wave has spread across the city. A light rain sprinkles the ground as a large figure jumps across the roof tops, landing with the massive thumps of a large inhuman creature. The Predator has been wounded and now seeks to return to his ship before the humans find him and kill him. Thus is the opening for Predator: Concrete Jungle.[CR]The game begins in 1930 and moves on to the year 2030 as the player controls a Predator from a third-person view in expansive levels. The Predator's arsenal includes a staff, maul, glaive, explosive mines, spear gun, and a set of claws that appear from the forearm. With those weapons the player is able to skin, slice, stab, crush, and mangle the many enemies in the game, ultimately hunting the alpha male whose skull would make a worthy prize.</plot>

		<plot>Jen meets a short gargoyle named Scree, who informs her that while she must leave the physical plane Mortalis and accompany him to the demon plane Oblivion. The creature who kidnapped Lewis and left her for dead is an agent of Abaddon who represents Chaos and has been locked in struggle for aeons with Arella, representing Order. The balance between Chaos and Order has been upset and it is Jen's task to restore the balance, all the while hoping to discover the whereabouts of Lewis.[CR]Primal can be described as a "3D platformer", being somewhat similar in its basic gameplay mechanics to Tomb Raider games. Puzzle-solving and action-based combat constitute the focus of the gameplay. The player can switch between Jen and Scree at any time; Jen is capable of fighting, but Scree is invulnerable to enemy attacks. When Jen is incapacitated in combat, Scree must quickly restore her to life within a time limit; failure to do so prematurely ends the game.[CR]Combat is heavily based on "finishing moves" and Jen's ability to transform into demonic forms. There are four demons Jen can merge herself with; they are obtained one by one as the game's narrative advances. These demonic forms allow Jen to use special abilities, which include jumping to extreme heights, unnaturally fast swimming, slowing down time, and using powerful weapons.</plot>

		<plot>Seven years after the events of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, the Prince finds himself constantly hunted by a terrible beast known as the Dahaka. The Prince seeks counsel from an old wise man who explains that whoever releases the Sands of Time must die. Because the Prince escaped his fate, it is the Dahaka's mission as guardian of the Timeline to ensure that he dies as he was meant to. The old man also tells of the Island of Time, where the Empress of Time first created the Sands. The Prince sets sail for the Island in an attempt to prevent the Sands from ever being created, an act he believes will appease the Dahaka. After a battle at sea with an enemy force led by a mysterious woman in black capsizes the Prince's ship, the Prince washes ashore unconsciously onto the Island of Time.</plot>

		<plot>Pump It Up: Exceed is a dancing game similar to the games in the Dance Dance Revolution series. The Pump It Up dance mat is different from the norm as the arrows are set on diagonals and includes a button in the middle which allows for more complexity in the dance moves that are required to be performed in the game.[CR]The general gameplay has the player watching a music video as symbols scroll by. The player must match the symbols on the screen with the symbols on the Pump It Up dance pad with their feet. Hitting the arrows in sync with the music will keep the players life bar up and give the player a good rating, while doing the opposite will drain the life bar and give bad ratings. If the life bar drains all the way, the game ends.[CR]The game has several mode to choose from:[CR]Arcade Mode has the player trying to achieve an “A” or an “S” rating on three consecutive songs. Doing that allows the player to play an extra song. Successfully completing songs in the Arcade mode opens them for play in Home Mode.[CR]Home Mode allows the player to choose any song they have available to them.[CR]Sudden Death Mode forces the player to perform a song flawlessly or the game ends.[CR]Survival Mode - This mode becomes available after the player completes twenty songs in the Home Mode. This is an endurance test for the player, as the game keeps giving the players songs to go through until their life bar is finally depleted.[CR]Video Mode - This mode is unlocked after the player completes a total of twenty songs in either Home or Arcade Mode. It allows the player to just watch the videos for any song they've completed.[CR]Tutorial mode - Teaches the player how the game works.[CR]The game also keeps track of the players statistics (the rating grades they received for each song). [CR]The PS2 version of the game features 101 songs, while the Xbox version contains 97 songs, but offers the option to download more songs. As some songs are more difficult then others, the game provides a rating from one to twenty to inform the player on just how hard of a task they are taking on by choosing a particular song.Two dance mats will be required for some songs that offer a freestyle option if the player chooses that setting.</plot>

		<plot>After the dedication of your new city is washed away in a cataclysmic flood, you find yourself in Raw Danger. Civilization as you know it has collapsed and now you must make your way out of the city while staying dry and warm in a metropolis that now resembles Atlantis. Gamers may take the role of six different people and play through several different storylines as they progress through the game. Each person is influenced by the actions of another. For example, if you place supplies and clothes in a locker the next character you play can find and use those items. [CR]The enemy in the game is hypothermia and water. If you remain in wet clothes and out of shelter for too long your body temperature drops and you die. To combat the cold you can locate such items as dry clothes and space heaters throughout the city while you search for a way out. Many obstacles will require you to jump, climb, and run your way through them, however several missions require a little more effort, such as riding a jet ski to escape an enormous wave. During the game you may come upon many non-player characters that can offer you supplies or interesting clues about how to vacate the soaked city. You may fully interact with these avatars and the game even allows you to make romantic connections with many of the saturated survivors.</plot>

		<plot>Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc is a 3D third-person platform game. Rayman, the main hero, jumps and punches his way through numerous colorful levels, with Globox (and Andre inside him) tagging along and occasionally commenting on the goings-on. Rayman's main weapon is his fist; he can use it to shoot projectiles at the attacking Hoodlums and other foes, and the projectiles are more powerful when the fist is charged by holding down the "shoot" button.[CR]The game is divided into several worlds, each divided into a couple of levels; the game is saved automatically after each level. In between the worlds, the player has to complete a mini-game where he has to surf along light-beams in a psychedelic environment.[CR]Rayman can also come across power-ups which temporarily give him a special power: the green power-up allows him to shoot tornadoes, the blue power-up gives him the ability to use a grappling hook, the yellow power-up allows him to fly for a short while, the orange power-up allows him to shoot precisely guided missiles and the red power-up grants him a very powerful fist that can bash doors. These power-ups are always necessary to defeat an enemy or a boss, or to get to the next part of the level.</plot>

		<plot>Ready 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2 is a boxing game for the Dreamcast, Nintendo 64, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, and Game Boy Advance. It is also the sequel to Ready 2 Rumble Boxing. Gameplay in the game is similar to that of the previous game. The more big hits the player land consecutively, letters that spell out "RUMBLE" appear below the player's side of the screen. Letters also appear when the fighter taunts his opponent. Once the word is formed, powerful combo attacks can be activated that will almost definitely knock the opponent down. This time, however, there are three levels of "RUMBLE", which build up one after the other. If the player successfully lands a combo with his RUMBLE Meter full on the third level (where the letters start smoking), the final blow can launch the opponent clear out of the ring, giving the player an instant victory.</plot>

The vast Ultor Corporation runs the mining operation on Mars.

		<plot>In the year 2075, five years after the events of Red Faction, on Mars, the nanotechnology developed by Capek has been claimed by the Earth Defense Force (EDF). With this technology, the EDF commences a reorganization of the Ultor Corporation with a particular focus on enhanced supersoldiers and suitable weaponry. However, the research that was done by Capek in his laboratories has been consequently stolen by other militant groups and assorted terrorist organizations. This has gone on for years; the research has changed hands in the criminal underworld many times. The player is introduced to the role of an explosives expert (codenamed "Alias"), as he embarks on a special operations mission to claim the research data for the Republic of the Commonwealth.[CR]Eventually, the research was successfully claimed by the elite forces of Victor Sopot, Chancellor of the dystopic military state known as The Commonwealth. Sopot uses the nanotechnology to enhance his already formidable military forces, and successfully creates the first supersoldiers with the research data. Fearing the potential of his new supersoldiers, he orders them all to be hunted down and executed at once and replaced with far less intelligent, mutated horrors known as "The Processed".</plot>

		<plot>This game, based on the famous Quentin Tarantino movie Reservoir Dogs, fills in the gaps in the movie that are only briefly mentioned (like the robbery at the jewelry store). Throughout the story you get to play all seven main characters, from Mr. Blonde to Mr. White. [CR]The missions are introduced by game engine cutscenes, which often recreate moments from the film. For example, in the first mission you see Mr. Pink holding his famous monologue "I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up!" and then you play Mr. Blue as the police arrives at the jewelry where your goal is to get out alive.[CR]To do so, you have two choices: be a psychopath and shoot your way out, or try the subtle approach without harming anyone. For instance, if you do not want to harm anyone you can take a hostage and then threaten the police to lay their weapons down and order them to face the wall. There are a few missions in which you must drive a car but mostly you walk through them. Like in the Hitman series, the game shows at the end of every mission how well you have done.</plot>

		<plot>In a combination of a horror game and light-gun game, Resident Evil: Dead Aim puts you on a cruise ship infested with zombies. You start off as Bruce McGivern, a US government agent sent to stop Morpheus D. Duvall from spreading the zombie T-virus any further. Along the way you'll run into Fongling, a Chinese government agent who is aboard the cruise ship for the same reason, and you'll also end up playing as her. All you really need to know is that there are zombies and you have to kill them.[CR]You'll pick up several different guns through the course of the game, including a magnum, a shotgun, and an assault rifle, but like in other Resident Evil games, zombies are difficult to put down permanently, and ammo can be very scarce.</plot>

		<plot>A complete remake of the classic 1986 title Defender of the Crown (not to be confused with the "Remastered" Windows version released in 2002), in Robin Hood: Defender of the Crown the player plays as the legendary folk outlaw in his quest to reclaim the throne of England after Richard Lionheart was captured in the crusades and his brother, John Lackland, usurped the throne and left him for dead in the Holy Land, attracting the ire of several knights. In a heated argument, he considered them to be traitors, causing a civil war to start.[CR]Several gameplay features were changed from the classic title such as the player being Robin Hood himself (instead of picking one of four pretenders), full 3D graphics, a plot included with the game and the goal being to be the first to reach and conquer King John's stronghold in Cornwall. To do so, the player must build an army large enough to hold enough shires, which generate money from taxes. This money can then be used to hire new troops (peasants, archers, footmen and the mighty knights and catapults) or pay King Richard's ransom, which allow to enlist loyalist knights.</plot>

		<plot>Rogue Ops is a third-person stealth-based action adventure title in the vein of Splinter Cell series. Many levels allow for a variety of tactics to be used, so often players may shoot everything that moves or simply sneak through entire missions. However, a few missions will require that no enemy alarms be set off, meaning players will have to dispose of enemies quietly and hide the bodies from detection. As in the Metal Gear and Splinter Cell series, a variety of spy gadgetry (fly cam, retinal scanner, etc.) and weapons (throwing stars, sniper rifle] remote-controlled mines, etc.) are used during the various missions, and hand-to-hand combat is involved during close encounters with the enemy.</plot>

They come under fire from the Norts due to the information that had been leaked by the General. Upon landing the first mission is a tutorial in how to use Rogue’s skills and also the Bio-chips of Gunnar and then Bagman. The third Bio-chip of Helm is received in a later mission. The Bio-chips have their own abilities. Gunnar is stuck to the side of Rogue’s rifle and can be used as a sentry while Rogue flanks the enemy. Bagman provides ammunition and upgrades for Rogue’s equipment made from salvage collected along the way and also looks after his health. Helm is used for accessing computer consoles and panels allowing Rogue access into prohibited areas.[CR]Rogue works his way through the various levels as stealthily as is possible trying to take the Norts by surprise with kill moves but with the arsenal at his disposal he is quite capable of also unleashing hell and going toe to toe with the enemy. Tracking the traitor General, Rogue eventually catches up in the final mission with an abundance of Norts trying to stop him.</plot>

		<plot>Romance of the Three Kingdoms X is the tenth installment of the long-running series and takes place right after the fall of the Han Dynasty. It nearly covers 147 years of Chinese history. Gameplay is the same as previous incarnations, an overhead view, letting the player and the CPU move armies, build cities, gather supplies and attack one another, watching the battles from afar.[CR]There are two different ways to play the game. The player can choose the Historical mode where the characters of the game will follow history to the letter, acting the way the did in real life, but players can also choose a Fictional mode where everything is random and the player can change history as they see fit.[CR]There are 650 playable characters to choose from, as well as the ability to create over 100 different officers. Players can also trade generals and view stats using online capability.</plot>

Several matches will require that the player be sworn not to use dirty tactics such as using weapons found around the ring or even to humiliate the opponent. These oaths can be broken by the player, but the consequences are the loss of fan popularity and for the player's chosen character to develop a dark side to their persona.</plot>

		<plot>Gamers return to the slopes in this third full edition of EA's exaggerated-action snowboarding series, SSX. As the game goes "On Tour," players create their own custom characters, which they'll develop from amateur bunny-hillers to seasoned "Black Diamond" pros. For the first time, the game allows skiers on the mountains as well, and players can decide if they'd rather ski or board when they create their characters. Building upon a distinguishing feature of the series, SSX On Tour features long, seamlessly streaming courses, some of which may take as long as half-an-hour (of real-time) to complete. The slopes are populated with fellow boarders and skiers in this edition, providing some extra personality. Featuring more than 40 songs, the diverse rock soundtrack includes selections by Def Leppard, The Hives, Iron Maiden, Bloc Party, Jurassic 5, and several others.</plot>

		<plot>Samurai Champloo steps out of the hack-and-slash action genre and offers a new way to swing a finely-honed samurai blade. Set in Japan with hip hop feel from the hit TV series by the same name, this title allows gamers to breathe life to a "lost episode" as one of three playable characters - Mugen, a reckless samurai with break-dancing fighting style, calculated Jin who abides by the decorum of Bushido, and a mysterious new character exclusive to the video game. Stranded in northern land of Ezo (current day Hokkaido) in search of the samurai who smells of sunflowers, the player must face foreign mercenaries, master swordsmen, diabolical assassins, mythical beasts, and gangster monkeys. The core of the game's unique combat system lies in the innovative integration of music and linked attacks. The players can choose an array of combos based on the different hip hop grooves that they can swap at will. Music tracks become collectible, opening an extensive assortment of linked attacks that can be implemented tactically during combat.</plot>

		<plot>Samurai Warriors is Koei's extension of the popular Dynasty Warriors series. Instead of taking place during the Three Kingdoms era in China, Samurai Warriors takes you back to feudal Japan, during the warring states era. In the game, you take control of actual historical figures such as Yukimura Sanada, Nobunaga Oda, and Hattori Hanzo. Altogether, there are fifteen characters, ten of whom need to be unlocked.[CR]Basically, gameplay is almost identical to that of Dynasty Warriors. The main differences are things like the inclusion of indoor castle levels, and a greater variety of enemies. In Dynasty Warriors, enemies were basically either soldiers or archers. In Samurai Warriors, there are soldiers, archers, musketeers, and many different types of ninjas. In terms of story, there are basically only five levels, but depending on your actions in a certain level specific to each character, the story will branch of into two different stories, leading to a good ending or a not as good ending. Updated graphics and a more "techno-ish" soundtrack top off the additions.</plot>

		<plot>Samurai Gojiro Kiryuu comes to the American West in search of his brother. His journey takes him to a corrupt town ruled by a sinister land baron named Goldberg. Though Gojiro isn't interested in righting wrongs, he is soon caught up in the town's problems: killing highway robbers, protecting a woman from would-be rapists, and thwarting Goldberg's machinations. Focused on destroying Gojiro, Goldberg unleashes an endless stream of minions... all fodder for Gojiro's blade. But Goldberg has an ace up his sleeve...[CR]Samurai Western is a third-person action game. Gojiro's blade is more than a match for Old West weaponry as he can ably deflect or sidestep bullets. As Gojiro completes levels, he upgrades his skills, unlocks new swords and stances, and adds Western accessories to his wardrobe. Primarily a single-player game, Samurai Western has a two player co-op mode and unlockable characters for both modes.</plot>

		<plot>Scaler is a 3D platform game with elements of combat, stealth, and puzzle-solving. Upon accidentally uncovering his neighbor's evil plot to take over the universe with an army of mutant lizards, Bobby "Scaler" Johnson is put in the position to infiltrate the operation and bring it down from the inside. He is transported to another dimension and transformed into a lizard himself. The enemy army is strong and diverse, however, with different mutant lizard soldier types that are well suited for various tasks.[CR]Luckily, after transforming from a boy into a lizard, changing from one lizard form to another eventually becomes relatively easy, and Scaler will need to assume the appearance and abilities of no fewer than five other creatures in order to accomplish all the objectives before him. [CR]Since certain goals can only be reached in one particular lizard form, part of the challenge can be figuring out which shape to take in each situation. Nevertheless, whether they realize it or not, all the good people of universe are depending on Scaler to prevent the impending mutant lizard uprising. Needless to say, perhaps, players expecting a serious, realistic, simulation-style game may be somewhat disappointed with Scaler.</plot>

Instead of being killed by the Skull, Tony manages to sense him and shoots him down. He fights through his mansion, with many deaths on both sides. In the ensuing chaos, Tony sneaks to the front of the mansion, barely alive, and manages to escape in his car. Sosa is then informed that Tony's mansion has been seized and his massive drug empire has been reduced to nothing. Hiding in a safehouse located outside of Miami, Tony regrets the decisions he has made but swears revenge on Sosa.</plot>

		<plot>Scooby-Doo! Night of 100 Frights is a third person platform game with action elements that was developed by Heavy Iron Studios and published by THQ for the PlayStation 2, GameCube and Xbox consoles. The game was first released on May 20, 2002 in North America and was released later that year in PAL regions. It is the first Scooby-Doo! video game title to come to sixth generation consoles. The game became a Greatest Hits title in 2003. The game had a follow up titled Scooby Doo: Mystery Mayhem.[CR]The game puts players in the control of Scooby-Doo in a story that revolves around him searching for the rest of the gang around a haunted mansion after they're kidnapped by an eccentric villain. The game has twelve areas, ranging from graveyards and secret labs to fishing villages and haunted mazes.[CR]The game received mixed reviews from critics, mainly criticizing the game's simplicity, although its massive environments staying true to the Scooby-Doo! universe was praised by critics and fans alike. Fans of the original show loved the game, feeling it was compensation for the N64 game released in 2000. The game also marks the first and only time Don Knotts did voice work for a video game, though he did do previous voice work in the Scooby-Doo universe.</plot>

		<plot>In Second Sight, players are cast as a mysterious man who, at first, cannot even remember his own name. Awakening from a coma in a strange, utilitarian facility, the hero finds that he does not know who he is or why he is there. Soon, he also finds that he has been gifted with strange, potentially deadly psychic abilities. He needs answers and, guided by players from a third-person perspective, must make use of both stealth tactics and his unusual mental powers to seek them out.[CR]Eventually, through careful observation and disturbing flashbacks, the player's character realizes that he was once part of a secret military organization, and that he came to this strange facility to recover from a failed mission in central Siberia. Further exploration and investigation reveals much more, as the hero comes to learn of other secret operations, far-reaching government conspiracies, and the soulless program of human experimentation which may have given him his strange psychic powers.</plot>

		<plot>There are a total of 12 different full games to play in the main mode of Sega Superstars:[CR] Sonic the Hedgehog – As Sonic runs down a round tunnel, he follows the position of the player's hand. Using this method, the aim of the game is to gather rings and Chaos Emeralds in order to obtain the highest score at the end of the game. It is much like the Special Stage on Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic Heroes, and especially Sonic Rush.[CR] Samba de Amigo – Players choose a song, and then must hit 6 different targets around the screen as the 'beat balls' reach them in time with the music. Posing with hands over 2 of the targets, or holding one position until a trail of beat balls is complete, may also be required from the player.[CR] ChuChu Rocket! – Movement over a certain target on the screen will cause a bridge to raise, which the chu-chus then follow to the goal. The bridge also must be dropped at certain moments to prevent KapuKapus from destroying the score.[CR] Puyo Pop Fever – Differently colored puyos will fall from the top of the screen, and the player's body must be positioned to guide them into the corresponding pots and allow bombs to topple off the bottom of the screen.[CR] Crazy Taxi – Large movements and loud sounds must be undertaken to stop the Crazy Taxi and complete the level.[CR] Super Monkey Ball – The player must move their arms into different positions in order to guide the monkey ball around obstacles and towards the goal, picking up as many bananas as possible along the way.[CR] NiGHTS Into Dreams – NiGHTS must be controlled and navigated through rings, collecting chips along the way, by raising your arms into a 'flying' position and adjusting them along the way.[CR] House of the Dead – A multitude of different zombies must be attacked and defeated by hitting them. Innocent people who occasionally appear must also be avoided.[CR] Virtua Striker – As footballs drop from the top of the screen, the aim is to head them into differently colored and scored balloons on the opposite side of the screen in order to obtain the highest score.[CR] Virtua Fighter – Standing to one side, players kick and punch the corresponding attack prompts on the screen in order to defeat the opponent. Block and counter prompts also appear, and must be reacted to accordingly.[CR] Space Channel 5 – Different dance move combination must be remembered when shown by the Morolians, and then repeated in time to the music by hitting six different buttons on the screen.[CR] Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg – By waving their hands over two different targets, players must move Billy and the egg around, and crush enemies and collect fruits along the way to the goal.</plot>

		<plot>Mike LeRoi -- the embittered protagonist of the original Shadow Man title, is tasked yet again with saving Liveside and the parallel world of Deadside. In this third-person action-adventure, a cult of demons known only as the Grigori (and who, incidentally, have been masquerading as humans for the past 2000 years), are intent on resurrecting their master, Asmodeus. Doing so will bring about a cataclysmic end to all of humanity. As both, Mike Leroi and his alter ego Shadow Man, players must explore six worlds; each with numerous sub-locations, in their quest to prevent these vile creatures from bringing their diabolical scheme to fruition.[CR]When engaged in combat Mike LeRoi can attack with a bevy of armaments, running the gamut from powerful projectile-based weapons to short-range melee ones with which to bludgeon an opponent to death with. Additionally, it's possible for players to equip a different weapon in each hand, or alternatively, to equip a single, heavier two-handed weapon. When wielded by Shadow Man himself, weapons take on additional properties. A lock-on cursor can be used to target specific enemies, allowing the player to dodge and attack with consummate ease. Interspersed throughout the title are puzzles that must be solved in order for Shadow Man to advance through the worlds.[CR]Throughout the quest Mike will experience constantly changing weather and time; day changes to night, and back again in real-time, with inclement weather prevailing in many parts of the game world. Returning to the fold are Mama Nettie and Jaunty, two of Shadow Man's cohorts from the original title, while Thomas Deacon, the wheelchair-bound guardian of an ancient book the Grigori are after, makes his debut appearance. Shadow Man: 2econd Coming features mature, violent themes that touch upon subjects such as religion and voodoo. The cut-scenes feature character dialogue that is equally adult oriented.</plot>

		<plot>Shadow of Memories (Shadow of Destiny in North America) is an adventure game. There are no action elements in the game, and the protagonist has no health bar. Each chapter has a time limit, during which Eike has to find a way to prevent the murderer from killing him. This is mainly achieved by traveling through time to different hours, days, years, and even centuries. Obtaining a crucial item, having a conversation with a specific character, or performing another action in the past will prevent Eike from getting killed. Time-traveling requires energy units, which can be found by exploring the town. If Eike fails to achieve the goal at hand within the allotted time and prevent his murder, the chapter must be restarted.</plot>

		<plot>Shadow of Rome is a third-person, action-adventure game with some elements of racing. The game has two types of gameplay: close quarters combat levels involving Agrippa and stealth-based, puzzle-solving adventure levels involving Octavianus.[2] There are also levels in which Agrippa competes in chariot races.[3][CR]Agrippa uses various gladiator weapons to fight, including swords, maces, spears, among others.[3] Agrippa can use special moves such as "Red Volcano"—a move used to slice enemies in half— to please the crowds.[2] As a result, the crowd will throw down items to help Agrippa.[4] Once a weapon is used enough, it will break, and the player will have to find a new one inside the area.[3][CR]In Octavianus' levels, the player sneaks around various locations in Rome. Octavianus cannot kill enemies, he can only knock them out. Other ways to pass these levels are by hiding in large pots or by stealing clothes and impersonating someone.[3]</plot>

		<plot>The game focuses on a young man named Wander who must travel across a vast expanse on horseback and defeat sixteen beings, simply known as colossi, to restore the life of a girl. The game is unusual within the action-adventure genre in that there are no towns or dungeons to explore, no characters with which to interact, and no enemies to defeat other than the colossi. Shadow of the Colossus has been described as a puzzle game, as each colossus' weakness must be identified and exploited before it can be defeated.</plot>

Hood.[CR]There is a Freeride mode and a Career mode where the player performs complex tricks to gather points, but also must perform certain tasks for each stage in order to advance to further levels such as performing certain tricks or jumping off certain ramps and picking up various items scattered throughout the stage. There are also multiplayer modes present that lets friends go head-to-head either by racing to the end of the stage first or out perform each other. It also features music from Papa Roach, Static-X and Alien Ant Farm.</plot>

		<plot>Shaun White Snowboarding gives the player, as the title suggests, a snowboard and sends him off to four ski run locations around the world (Europe, Alaska, Japan and a fictitious location called Park City) under the watchful eye of professional snowboarder Shaun White himself as well as other professionals, moderators, pilots and such. But before the player can go on the slope, he has to create his character by choosing not only from different body looks but also from different clothes and snowboards. During the course of the game the player earns money by completing the challenges which can in return be invested in more stylized clothes and additional types of snowboards. Each of the boards has six stats like balance or speed and not all of them are the best possible option for every given situation. While in a race speed is an important factor, a board with a higher rating in rotation allows for better stunts. The game puts the player in an open world with him free to roam around the slope as he pleases. Several lifts and even a helicopter bring him to different starting locations but if he wants, he can also walk and discover hidden areas by doing so. By doing tricks, with controls using mainly the analog sticks similar to Skate, the player earns respect points. And on the track are, besides many obstacles to perform tricks on, challenges like the Jibfest, in which only tricks on rails and boxes count or Freestyle in which every trick counts. Others include the Death Race, in which the player needs to get to the goal before everyone else but as the name suggests, everything is allowed including ramming opponents and throwing snowballs to get them off-balance. There are also some challenges like King of the Hill that can only be done with at least one other human player joining in. The multiplayer mode is basically an extension of the single player experience. Everything that is available in single player, can also be done with other players online or over LAN. The other players are also just dropped into the open world with the freedom to just do what they want on the server.</plot>

		<plot>Shifters, also known as Shifters of Might and Magic, is a 2002 action role-playing video game developed and published by The 3DO Company for the PlayStation 2 in 2002. Set in the fictional Might and Magic universe, it is a direct sequel to the PlayStation 2 incarnation of Warriors of Might and Magic.[CR]The player controls Alleron, the lead character from Warriors of Might and Magic. Within this game Alleron must defeat the mysterious horde of flesh and metal invaders who are replacing the villages with steam-powered cities. Unlike the previous game, Alleron has gained the power to shapeshift and can assume 24 different creature forms, such as a humanoid ram and a griffin-like creature.[CR]Alleron travels through six different worlds in which he must do battle with members of a specific race. Often, these areas end in boss battles, although not always. Along the way, there are many "secret" areas that are accessible only to particular forms, such as areas blocked off by bars or grates (which can only be accessed in Genie form after having cast the Gaseous Form spell). No matter the choices of forms, however, the main game can always be completed.[CR]The combat system has multiple ways of approaching enemies as there are different combos that can be executed based on which buttons are pressed and when they are pressed. The different forms and the different weapons will have different combos, some of which can end in an attack that may send the enemies flying. Many of the new forms come with a new spell as well, often times making a form that lacks in the physical fighting area more useful, some of which are the spells which can be used to gain access to previously inaccessible areas which often have secrets or treasures. Spells useful for combat also can be gained, allowing evening of certain circumstances should the odds seem out of the player's favor.</plot>

		<plot>Junkyard, a town of endless rain. With his four companions, Serf, the main character and a member of a tribe called Embryon, sets out for Nirvana, a land that can only be reached by the champions of Junkyard. They devote themselves to fighting against the never-ending resistance mustered by other tribes. In the midst of chaos, a mysterious object, the Pod, suddenly appears. Countless spheres of light are emitted by the Pod and infect Serf and his comrades, awakening their demonic powers. An unimaginable battle unfolds within their faint conscience. They develop a desire to tear the flesh and shatter the bones of their enemies, who have also been transformed. Their instincts tell them to devour every being in their path.

		<plot>In Persona 3, you’ll assume the role of a high school student, who was orphaned as a young boy, and has recently transferred to Gekkoukan High School on Port Island. Only days after he arrives at the school dorm, he is attacked by a Shadow. The assault awakens his Persona, Orpheus, his only chance at defeating this creature of the night. He soon discovers that he shares this special ability with other students at his new school. From them he learns of the Dark Hour, a hidden time that exists between one day and the next, swarming with Shadows that have been slowing claiming victims known as The Lost—poor souls who have inexplicably been turned into walking zombies. Under the supervision of school chairman Shuji Ikutsuki, he joins his new friends in confronting this evil threat. With your school as the primary battlefield, you’ll be forced to juggle between two lives: student by day, defender against evil by night. And your greatest challenges await you on the eve of each full moon.</plot>

		<plot>Shining Tears is an old-school Action RPG set in the Shining universe (previous games include Shining in the Darkness and the Shining Force Trilogy). You play Xion, a hero who is drawn into saving the City of Shilidia from a formerly peaceful neighbor due to his possession of the powerful Twin Dragon Rings. This sets the stage for an epic RPG storyline with fun characters and big surprises.[CR]Presented in beautiful hand-drawn 2D graphics and backgrounds, players may choose to go into battles from among 8 unlockable companions, each with their own unique powers, strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, the co-op system lets two players cooperate in battles, pulling off special combo moves and leveling up their characters together. Interestingly, the companion you pick changes Xion to the opposite 'soul' dark or light due to the nature of the Twin Dragon Rings, with correspondingly different powers. Single players have their companion AI to help them out of tight spots, too.</plot>

When the player reaches the end of a Shoxzone, the player is rewarded with cash based on the time taken to cross it, divided into Gold, Silver and Bronze. However, if the player takes too long to cross the zone, beyond the Bronze time, a reward will not be given. Shox doesn't feature the genre's traditional gameplay modes. Instead of time trial, single race, and career modes, Shox has only one: the championship mode where players take one of 24 cars through 30 different races that are spread across five unique leagues.</plot>

		<plot>Billed as a re-imagining of the original Silent Hill, Shattered Memories once again casts you as Harry Mason searching across the haunted town for his missing daughter Cheryl. New to the series are a depiction of Silent Hill's demonic alter-dimension as a world of ice, and the removal of weapons from the game - when the monsters come out, Harry must literally run for his life.[CR]Between scenes, the game will cut to a psychiatrist's office, who asks you personal questions about yourself and your past experiences. The game will then alter itself based on your responses, changing characters and lines of dialog to something intended to be more personally uncomfortable.[CR]As you search for Cheryl, you will come across objects and recordings that tell some of the history of Silent Hill.</plot>

He looks at his door, only to see it is blocked by several thick metal chains. A note is pinned to the door: "Don't go out!" It is signed only by a man named Walter. Henry explores his apartment, trying to figure out what is happening, when he spots a giant hole in the wall of his bathroom. Henry goes through the hole, only to find a portal which leads him to alternate dimensions. Hopefully, Henry will find out the truth about his apartment, Room 302, and live.</plot>

		<plot>The Sims 2 is a 2004 strategic life simulation video game developed by Maxis and published by Electronic Arts. It is the sequel to the best-selling computer game The Sims.[CR]The game has the same concept as its predecessor: players control their Sims in various activities and form relationships in a manner similar to real life. The Sims 2, like its predecessor, does not have a defined final goal; gameplay is open-ended. Sims have life goals, wants and fears, the fulfillment of which can produce both positive or negative outcomes. All Sims age, and can live to 90 sim days depending on the degree to which their aspirations are fulfilled. The Sims 2 builds on its predecessor by allowing Sims to age through six stages of life and incorporating a 3D graphics engine. Although gameplay is not linear, storylines exist in the game's pre-built neighborhoods. Pleasantview is based 25 years after the town in the original The Sims. Strangetown's storyline is based on the supernatural, and is loosely connected with Pleasantview. Veronaville's characters are based on Shakespearean characters.[CR]The Sims 2 was first released on September 14, 2004 for Microsoft Windows. A port to Mac OS X was released on June 17, 2005. Eight expansion packs and nine stuff packs were subsequently released. In addition several console versions have been released. The Sims 2 is offered on mobile platforms, with manufacturers such as Nokia offering The Sims 2 from the Ovi Store. A sequel, The Sims 3, was released in June 2009.[CR]The Sims 2 was a commercial success, selling one million copies in its first ten days, a record at the time. During April 2008, The Sims 2 website announced that 100 million copies of The Sims series had been sold. The Sims 2 was well received by critics, gaining a 90% score from aggregators Metacritic and GameRankings. By March 2012, The Sims 2 had sold over six million PC copies, and 13 million over all platforms, making it one of the best-selling PC games of all-time.</plot>

		<plot>The game begins on a boat after the player creates a crew of characters. The crew can consist of one to six Sims. After the crew's creation, a slide-show starts of some mobile phone pictures that are taken showing the trip and also showing the storm that wrecks the ship. The player's starting Sim wakes up on First Beach on Shipwreck Island. The Sim finds books detailing the goals the Sim must follow to survive on the islands and escape. Shortly after exploring Shipwreck Island, the Sim discovers a second island, Airplane Island, this one considerably larger and more interesting than the first, and builds a raft to reach the new location. After arriving on the island, the Sim is reunited with some of their lost crew. The player then has the option to form a tribe of Sims if the relationship is strong enough. While exploring Airplane Island, the player finds radio parts that are required to complete a goal later in the game. A third island, Volcano Island, can be reached once the player finds the second beach on Airplane Island and builds a canoe. On Volcano Island, the player will discover the remains of the llama people. The player has the option to return to civilization on this island. They can either build a boat or travel to the volcano's summit and use the radio parts to send an SOS signal to a nearby ship. The player can also repair a broken ceremonial forge on Volcano Island that will cause a fourth island, Crystal Island, to rise out of the sea, however this is optional and is not required for the player to escape the island. The game contains many discoverable secrets, including secret areas such as Hidden Lagoon and the Secret Pirate's Cove. These areas can only be accessed once the player has gathered objects such as hieroglyphics and treasure map pieces, however this is a relatively extensive process.</plot>

		<plot>SingStar games require players to sing along with music in order to score points. Players interface with their console via SingStar microphones while a music video plays in the background. The pitch players are required to sing is displayed as horizontal grey bars, which function similar to a musical stave, with corresponding lyrics displayed at the bottom of the screen. The game analyses a player's pitch and timing which is compared to the original track, with players scoring points based on how accurate their singing is. Different modes of SingStar may vary this basic pattern, but the principle is similar throughout.</plot>

		<plot>SkyGunner is a third person flight combat game, with its emphasis on action. Players choose to take the role of either Ciel, Femme, or Copain, each with their own campaign and unique flying abilities and special skill. Players can turn the plane's direction up, down, left and right, perform barrel rolls, and use afterburners. Weaponry is handled by a complex system of targeting, with involves two types: "Look Targeting" and "Weapon Lock". Look Targeting simply assigns a particular enemy at the center of the camera and can be switched between at any time. The player must still maneuver near the enemy and target them with the cross hairs in order to shoot them. Depending on the secondary weapon selected, players can roll the cross hairs over the wing leader of an enemy group or the sequentially lead gun on a battleship, allowing the player to instantly target multiples from that group.[CR]The primary weapon of each airplane is a machine gun which fires straight ahead. More destructive secondary weapons are also available, that includes Firework Missiles which create area explosions, Dog Missiles which slow and/or immobilize targets and Cross Missiles which stick to targets and need to be shot by a machine gun to detonate. Copain also has his own weapon, the Pumpkin Bomb which is a big destructive bomb. These secondary weapons are automatically replenished with the destruction of chains of enemies and/or combos. Chains/Combos are also the way to activate score multipliers, which affect the amount of money won in each mission. Ciel, Copain and Femme are continually in competition throughout the game and often bonuses (such as faster engines) are given to the character with the highest score in specific missions. Bonus scores are also awarded for specific mission events.</plot>

		<plot>Sly and the gang is back in this third outing of Sly Raccoon-series. This time, the story takes the boys (Sly, Bentley and Murray) to the fortress that houses the treasures of Sly's family. Although they are still weary from the adventures in the previous game, they have to get up and face the new threat that could mean the end of Sly's business and the loss of his family heritage. The game itself is a lot like the previous games: Sly sneaks, jumps, and swings himself around the levels, collecting various items, defeating bad guys and ultimately taking on the boss character. The other members of the gang step in on the action once in a while but the Sly centric sections are the main focus of the game. If you like games that had many things to do, this sneak-em-up/platform/action/adventure/puzzle game is for you.</plot>

		<plot>Sniper Elite is a third-person action strategy game with a focus on sniping. The player takes on the role of an American agent working for the OSS (the organization that later became the CIA) stationed in Berlin at the end of World War II, tasked with preventing the Russian troops from getting hold of the research Germany had been conducting into nuclear weaponry. As an elite sniper, the style of play is much less run-and-gun and much more about finding good positions, lining up shots and taking out the enemy before he even knows where you are.[CR]The single-player campaign takes place over 28 missions set in and around Berlin. Players use stealth tactics, and things like wind and background noise can be a factor when lining up shots. When a shot is performed particularly well, players are rewarded with a 'bullet cam' which follows the bullet in slow-motion from gun barrel to target. It can be played with a friend in local 2-player co-op. Players can revive each other.</plot>

		<plot>Soul Nomad and the World Eaters begins in a world called Prodesta where an evil entity named Gig has returned with his three beasts known as World Eaters. The land of Prodesta has battled these monsters before, two hundred years earlier when Princess Layna sacrificed herself to capture the enemies and save the land from certain doom. Now they are back and you are the chosen hero who must battle through several environments to keep Prodesta alive. After creating your character, you learn that Gig has possessed your body and is offering you his strength to defeat your foes. Unfortunately, the powers you accept from Gig allow him to overtake more of your mind. A large part of the game is learning how much power you can use before you are completely consumed by evil. You are sent through the world to battle Gig's minions on grid-based battlefields with a party of your creation. Your group is composed of soldiers you purchase with Gig points, and you must set them up on the battleground so that their attributes and skills are put to good use. However, if you are running low on points you can also kidnap townsfolk and force them to join your cause. Battle is based around team work, and there are 40 different group abilities you may add to your arsenal as you attempt to defeat the enemy and save Prodesta.</plot>

You'll control either Ham III or Luna, depending on the level, with Ham III having a stronger melee ability, and Luna having ranged attacks. There are hidden Globhoppers in each level, which let you unlock movie clips and concept art, and one Dole Banana in each level, which let you unlock costumes.</plot>

Use ultra-violent special attacks to mow down entire groups of foes at once, with ridiculously bloody effect.[CR]The game has a fast-paced, arcade-like, mission-based gameplay. In each mission, you must succeed in minor goals like killing the generals of the opposition, escorting sappers to blow up enemy siege weaponry and preventing the enemy from making to behind your borders. The storyline progresses through cutscenes, shown in-between each mission.[CR]Depending on how you succeed in your mission, you get "tokens", which you can use to upgrade the health, damage or power of your character. The player is capable of doing special moves, which can be learned throughout the game. Some of the special moves gain their powers through the spartan gods, that aid the player in his battle. During the game, you can find different weapons like swords, bows and spears, and of course, shields.</plot>

In the world of street motorcycle racing, you'll weave through traffic, pull off flashy stunts, run from police, and race to the finish line. Your high-performance bikes--including sport, road, touring, and custom models--each have their own type of handling and top speeds. Perform jumps, power-downs, skids, wheelies, and stoppies, but be careful--failed attempts at these tricks result in real-time damage to both bike and rider.</plot>

		<plot>The game is a racing game in the vein of the F-Zero series, including tracks full of odd twists, turns and loops impossible by realistic standards, set in five vibrant, exotic locations (six in the PS2 version). The goal of the game is not only to win first place in each race, but also to have the most points by the end of the cup to win the competition. Points can be earned by placing high during races, but also by performing stunts and, most commonly, bashing into and destroying other racers with the use of car acrobatics, called "car-fu" in the game.</plot>

		<plot>Spider-Man finds himself beset by his movie villains. He gains help from New Goblin as he combats the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Sandman, and Venom. All six characters suddenly find themselves targeted by an enemy force and one-by-one, the villains begin disappearing. Meanwhile, Spider-Man is rescued by Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D., who informs him that the meteor which brought the Venom symbiote to Earth had broken up in the Earth's atmosphere and five more pieces had landed in numerous locations across the globe. Fury sends Spider-Man to retrieve the shards of meteors. Spider-Man quickly finds that the villains who attacked him and several more of his foes, including Rhino and Scorpion, have been placed under mind control of a mysterious villain. The villain also creates and controls holographic/symbiote combination foot soldiers called P.H.A.N.T.O.M.s (short for Perpetual Holographic Avatar Nano-Tech Offensive Monsters). As Spider-Man fights his enemies one-by-one and rescues them from the mind control, they promise to aid him in finding the villain responsible. As Spider-Man progresses, he obtains more allies such as Black Cat, Iron Fist, Lizard (not portrayed as a villain), and Blade. He discovers that the evil genius is Mysterio, who intends to use his army to take over the world, using each shard of the meteor to make them stronger. Spider-Man decides to temporarily don the Black Suit for the final battle.</plot>

		<plot>[I]Spider-Man: Web of Shadows - Amazing Allies Edition[/I] is a 2D side-scroller with 3D graphics. The story is similar to the seventh-generation console versions. A break-off piece of Venom's symbiote begin infecting New Yorkers and it is up to Spider-Man to save the city. He can switch between the back and red suits at any time, which each have their own move set and abilities.[CR]As Spider-Man defeats enemies, he is given skill points which can be used to purchased boosted stats and new moves. These are separate for each costume. In general, red focuses on agility and black on brutality. In order to purchase moves you must have not only the necessary points, but sufficient reputation. Throughout the game, you have conversations with other characters where you are given red, black or neutral choices. Answering red or black will build that suit's reputation, as will various other actions throughout the game.[CR]You can take five power-ups into each level. These can be special abilities, such as temporary invincibility, or the eponymous allies. When summoned, they appear on screen and do their specific type of damage, then disappear. Allies are unlocked by beating bosses. The red suit unlocks hero allies like Luke Cage and Storm and the black suit unlocks villain allies like Galactus and Hobgoblin.</plot>

		<plot>The plot deals with Alec Sects as he tries to deal with the remains of Nostra, which have all formed separate groups. He eliminates the head of the Russian faction (The Cossack) before moving to New Orleans to meet Senator Noah Thurgood. However a clone of the Interceptor(the main vehicle) destroys Thurgood's car, and escapes by causing a diversion, attacking an IES boat. Alec proceeds to kill the man behind the attack, "Mad Mojo" Carter, leader of the American faction of Nostra. Alec proceeds to Asia where his partner Agent Vanessa Duvelle, has been kidnapped and held for execution. Alec breaks her out and kills the head of the Asian faction of Nostra, McGuinty. They then move to the Alps, where Alec destroys a second Interceptor clone. Later he learns that Thurgood was alive, and the mastermind. Thurgood escapes to the Arctic, where he has created an "Ark" and plans to flood the world by melting the ice, while he and select others rule what's left. Alec destroys the ark, and they are ordered to their next mission in Los Angeles</plot>

		<plot>Elite Force is based on the fourth Star Trek television series, Star Trek: Voyager. The series follows the adventures of the Starfleet vessel USS Voyager, which is stranded by an enigmatic alien power in the Delta Quadrant of the Milky Way galaxy. 70,000 light-years from Federation space, the series shows Voyager's effort to make the 75-year journey home. The stardate of 53854.7 given in the game places Elite Force in the latter parts of the sixth season of Star Trek: Voyager, in the year 2376. Significant parts of the game are set on Voyager itself, although much of the game takes place on away missions to other ships and space stations. The player interacts with several races from the series, such as the Borg, Hirogen and Malon, as well as new species created solely for the game.</plot>

		<plot>Star Wars: Battlefront encompasses battles between four main factions from both the original and prequel trilogies: the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems (CIS) of the prequel era, and the Rebel Alliance and Galactic Empire of the classic trilogy. However, factions can only play their historical adversary; there cannot be any Rebels vs. Separatists or Clones vs. Empire fights. In each faction, five different classes of characters become available. Four of the classes are similar for each faction: a basic infantry soldier (a Super battle droid for the CIS), heavy weapons soldier, pilot and sniper. Also featured are special characters for each group including: Droidekas (CIS), Jet Troopers (Republic), Dark Troopers (Imperials), and Wookie Smugglers (Rebels).[CR]Two players can play splitscreen co-op throughout the story campaign or a strategic Galactic Conquest campaign.There is also a "comp stomp" configuration that supports 2 players offline, 2 players splitscreen online, or up to 16 players online.Drop-in/drop-out is only supported in online matches.</plot>

		<plot>The player controls Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi in the single player mode, reliving various scenes from the film through the game's missions. There are 17 levels, interlaced with over 12 minutes of footage from the movie. Enemies include droids, clone soldiers and Neimodian forces. The game's combat system is heavily concentrated on lightsaber combat. Each of the playable characters (with the exception of the IG-100 Magnaguard) is equipped with at least one lightsaber. There are three basic attacks: Fast attacks which do the least amount of damage, Strong Attacks which do more damage but are slower to execute, and the slowest but strongest Critical Attacks. These attacks can be mixed to create combination attacks. Attacks can also be charged up for greater strength. One feature of the game is called a Saber Lock - a sequence in which the player's character clashes swords with an opponent. Other offensive maneuvers are also available, including grapples, jumps and flying kicks.</plot>

		<plot>It's Star Wars like you have never seen it before. Each character, from Episode 1, looks more like something from a Japanese animation.[CR]While flying around the many familiar landscapes (Tatooine, the underwater village Otoh Gunga and a driod control ship in orbit over Naboo) your character can use the many weapons and power-ups that litter the tracks, as well as using moves that only they can perform. For example. Jar-Jar uses his tongue to grab onto anyone in front of him, so he can catch up, while Darth Maul throws his double edged lightsaber as a very deadly weapon.[CR]Also keep an eye out for monsters and items that get in the way on the track. Some may be useful, others very annoying.</plot>

		<plot>Star Wars: The Force Unleashed gaps the story between Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith and Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, which tells of how the Rebellion was brought to be. The player takes control of a young boy who was discovered by Darth Vader while fighting the boys Jedi father on the planet of Kashyyk. Vader takes the boy as his own secret apprentice, training him to bring down the rest of the surviving Jedi's scattered across the galaxy.[CR]The majority of the game has the player exploring levels, using force powers such as lightning and grip to decimate opponents by throwing them off of high areas, electrocuting them or even using environmental objects to slam them into their opponents as well Force Repulse that can propel enemies backwards. There is also the classic light-saber, slicing opponents up with the ability to change its colors by finding different color crystals throughout the game.[CR]Players can upgrade these powers by destroying enemies, filling up on blue orbs that are left behind to earn points to earn more powerful attacks. More force orbs can be obtained by using flashy and complex on enemies. The player will also encounter bosses towards the end of the levels, ranging from Jedi's to large creatures like a Rancor. To kill these bosses, the player must complete a series of button pressing scenes, like in the God of War games.[CR]This version differs from it's next-gen brethren, only featuring the Havok engine and different level layouts, including a new level that involves the remains of the Jedi Temple as well as story differences (ex: In the first stage of the game the player takes control of Darth Vader, on the PS3 and 360 version, Vader lands in the middle of the day to encounter a Fleet Admiral and fight the Jedi at the end at his hut, while the PS2 version has Vader landing in the night, encounter a Clone Commander and fight the Jedi in an open field, surrounded by wreckage and fires from downed Tie-Fighters).</plot>

		<plot>Starsky and Hutch is an arcade racing game based on the popular TV series from the 70s, released to tie in with the film. The game includes 18 missions, each based on an episode of the TV show and introduced by Antonio 'Huggy Bear' Fargas. There is also a free roaming mode, in which the player explores the GTA-esque environment looking for action and trouble.[CR]Like the film, the game does not entirely play it straight. Starsky and Hutch are actually shooting a TV show, and the scoring for each mission reflects how ratings-friendly your driving is. You are awarded gold, silver or bronze medals for each mission depending on performance, and must get at least 1 gold and 2 silvers on season 1 for a second season to be commissioned, and 3 golds and 2 silvers in season 2 for there to be a third for you to play through.[CR]The overall goal in each mission is usually to chase and destroy a criminal's car. There is always a secondary target as well. In addition, the player will gain viewers by hitting the bad guy, pulling off elaborate jumps and skids, nearly hitting civilians, and hitting the bonus targets such as canisters which are strewn through the levels. Hitting civilians will lose viewers.</plot>

		<plot>The world is dying. The country of Solum are surrounded by poisonous fog. This fog devours everything on its way, and is slowly moving towards the few remaining towns and villages, about to consume the rest of humanity. The main religion of this world, Aeque, preaches that this is the will of God, and that the human beings should not resist and allow themselves to extinct. But an underground rebel movement is trying to dispel the fog with a magical structure called Gate of Eternity. Spero, the young protagonist of the game, must find his place amidst the conflict between the Empire he serves and the rebels.[CR]Stella Deus is a tactical role-playing game. You command your units by moving them around the isometric battle view. Each action - whether movement, physical attack, or magic spell - requires action points (AP). After the battles, your characters gain levels and get new abilities. Outside of battle, you can tackle the huge optional dungeon, Catacomb of Trials, and access towns via the menu. In towns you can fuse items to obtain more powerful ones, and receive side quests which mostly involve going to a certain place on the map and participating in a battle there.</plot>

You and your partner in crime, Louie Palmer, have recently landed a job to steal a statue that's been placed in a museum for an exhibition. Once you're in the museum things turn out not to be quite so easy and not quite the way the should be.[CR]The gameplay resembles Thief: The Dark Project but also feels a lot like Splinter Cell and Metal Gear Solid to an extent. Several elements can be recognized from those games, but many of these have been changed slightly or just implemented in an original way. The core of the game is about stealing, without killing.</plot>

But when a greedy baker plans to take over their hometown and steal all their hard-earned crops, she and her friends journey to the Land of Dreams in order to turn back the tide.[CR]Just like most platforming games, you jump, collect coins, er, seeds, and explore your way throughout various levels. There are also some minigames, which, though uninspired for a hardcore gamer, would probably keep a child occupied.[CR]In later levels players will be given access to various dream powers, which is functionally similar to Plasmids in BioShock, allowing the player to spawn platforms or zap enemies at the cost of some points, which can be recharged somewhat like EVE.[CR]The game also includes some interesting extras such as recipes for various desserts, as well as extra playable characters and a virtual farm mode which allows players to grow various plants.</plot>

		<plot>Strike Force Bowling is a video game of the sports genre released in 2004 by LAB Rats. A previous game, Fast Lanes Bowling, was published by Enlight Software. The two games are very similar sharing the same physics engine and graphics, although Strike Force featured more locations as well as left-handed, and reverse-hook bowlers. LAB Rats assisted in the development of Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowling so the game has the same physics engine, but has a more fantasy-oriented theme. Strike Force features 14 places to Bowl (12 in Fast Lanes) and 8 Playable characters. There are only 7 locations, but each has its own "nighttime" variant which is unlocked as a secret stage. It also features Golf Mode, Challenge Mode, Skins, and Tournaments. There are also 14 different bowling balls to use, such as the Lightning, and level specific ones like the Bone Crasher and Pharaoh's Magic.</plot>

		<plot>Stuntman: Ignition is a game based on the original 2002 Stuntman game. Players assume the role of a Hollywood stunt driver working for a movie studio. Each level is based upon a movie and players will have to drive through the level, earning points by performing stunts. After the end of each level, players can review their performance by watching the movie trailer that was created.[CR]There are six movies to choose from, each with different settings, goals and challenges: Aftershock, Whoopin and a Hollerin' II, Strike Force Omega, Overdrive, Never Kill Me Again and Night Avenger. Each movie consists of 6 scenes where the goals set by the director must be followed. To progress, a successful series of stunts is required, but the amount of points can be increased by linking them together and adding extra danger by drifting, getting airborne, or getting close to other cars and obstacles.[CR]The multiplayer portion offers 2 game modes. In Backlot Battle players have to perform as many stunts as possible in a set amount of laps. Backlot Race offers straightforward racing where boost is earned through stunts. The PS2 version only offers offline gameplay, while the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions have multiplayer supported through the DemonWare middleware.</plot>

Players can switch between third person and first person depending on their preference, and will shoot a lot of hideous demonic manifestations of evil before the game is done.

The game includes a morality system which records the player's actions during gameplay and changes the story accordingly, and also alters the player's creature form. Everything from the first The Suffering has been refined and turned up a notch for the sequel.[CR]The story picks up right where the first game left off. The player once again takes on the role of Torque, former death row inmate with a mysterious past. Now returning to his home town of Baltimore, Torque must confront the mysterious Blackmore, the man who may or may not have killed Torque's family. But it won't be easy, as the hideous creatures from the first game have now overrun the streets of Baltimore. Will Torque finally be able to come to grips with his past?</plot>

The guard and jump button can be pressed together to execute a dash move. Super DBZ features both ground-based and air-based fighting. Stages are multi-layered, and you can move between different areas, taking the fight to an area that's more advantageous to your character.</plot>

		<plot>This game is basically a fusion of Super Monkey Ball 1 and 2 for the PS2 and XBox. All of the levels from those two games are available in this collection, and all of the minigames are already unlocked and included. Formerly only available to GameCube players, the Super Monkey Ball series has made it to the PS2 and Xbox after a wait of almost 3 and a half years.[CR]The game itself plays very much like the old arcade game Marble Madness. You control a monkey in a ball, and you have to navigate it through many perilous labyrinths to the finish. In the previous two games you had limited lives/tries, but here you have infinite lives, which makes it all the easier.</plot>

The turtles then head off to rescue Leo, and they achieve this goal, right before the temple self-destructs. The turtles then go to Max Winter's tower, and Winters tells his story of being an immortal warrior named Yaotl. Yaotl was planning to activate a portal to another world, but it released 13 monsters into the earth. Yaotl became immortal, but it also turned his generals to stone. Yaotl then planned to stop his mistakes and his immortality by waiting for the portal to come again, and send all the monsters back to whence they came. He also made his generals come to life, but they remained in stone form. The Stone Generals wanted to live forever, so they turned on Yaotl. The turtles, however, managed to defeat the Generals, the portal opened, and the monsters returned to their dimension. Yaotl then thanks the turtles and dies happy and free from guilt. After the story, the turtles all realize the importance of family and grow closer as not only a family but also as a team.</plot>

		<plot>Ty the Tasmanian Tiger is a platform game in which the player controls Ty, a Tasmanian tiger, who must gather 17 Fire Thunder Eggs, 17 Ice Thunder Eggs, and 17 Electric Thunder Eggs, in order to power the Talisman Machine, a teleportation device that will locate all five talismans,[2] which will in turn have the power to free his family from the Dreamtime,[3] The game takes place in "Rainbow Cliffs", which is in turn divided into a series of "zones", each of which act as the hub areas of the game. Each zone contains three portals, each of which lead to a level.[4] The goal of each level is to obtain a select amount of thunder eggs, which can be retrieved by either performing a certain task, completing a "Time Attack" challenge that can be unlocked upon said level's completion, freeing five bilbies,[2] a group of animals who raised Ty after his parents were imprisoned, or by being found alongside the level's set path.[2] A level is cleared either by collecting a select amount of thunder eggs and reaching the end of the path, or beating certain min-games, each will return Ty to Rainbow Cliffs hub world.[2] Retrieving a thunder egg in a level will cause it to appear on the game's pause menu.[5] When at least seventeen thunder eggs in a zone are obtained, the player must navigate their way to the talisman machine; after the machine manages to locate a talisman, it opens another portal leading to their original locations; inside these portals, the player must fight and defeat a boss character before gaining access to a new zone</plot>

		<plot>After helping the Bunyup Elder by ridding the Dreamtime of the dangerous Quinkan, Ty heads for home. However, something goes wrong, and Ty winds up six months in the future! The Quinkan have invaded Southern Rivers, and even worse, the Bush Rescue team from the previous game has disbanded during Ty's absence! It's up to Ty to reunite his team members, as well as stop the Quinkan from unleashing the mysterious Quinking, an evil being of supreme power.[CR]Night of the Quinkan is the third game in the Ty series. As Ty, players can bite at foes, or use his boomerangs for consecutive ranged attacks. Boomerangs can be customized in an assortment of ways: either by changing the chassis (each chassis has its own special abilities); or by equipping special Bunyip Stones to the boomerang's chassis. Some stones can be combined with others, allowing players to customize their attacks to their liking. Some stones are rewards for completing tasks; others, as well as boomerang chassis, can be purchased from the Rang Shop in exchange for Opals, the game's currency.[CR]Ty 3 again rolls out the robotic mechs - choose from the Shadow or Extreme Bunyip (your standard mech), the Crabmersible (a submarine shaped like a crab, oddly enough), or the Gunyip (a speedy airplane with an assortment of bombs and guns). Ty can even take part in cart races against other characters for powerups and even more opals.</plot>

		<plot>Taiko Drum Master is an entry in Namco's Taiko No Tatsujin rhythm game series and the first to have a Western release. As in other rhythm games, the goal is to interact with a special controller according to scrolling onscreen prompts timed to music. This game comes bundled with the TaTaCon drum controller, a miniature version of a Japanese taiko drum with sensors in the middle and on the sides.[CR]In-game actions are indicated by scrolling circle icons. Red circles indicate hitting the center of the drum, while blue circles require the player to hit the edge. On big circles, the player can hit both center or edge sensors for bonus points. Finally, yellow lines and balloons require the player to perform drum rolls.[CR]The game comes with a varied set of tunes: from covered pop hits like Material Girl and ABC to music from other Namco games such as Katamari Damacy and Dragon Spirit and even television theme songs. In addition, there are also several mini-games included on the disc that use the TaTaCon for more esoteric purposes, such as watermelon eating and wolf-stacking.</plot>

		<rom name="ps2-redump-usa-chd-part-T/Tak and the Power of Juju (USA).chd" size="2292457871"/>
		<plot>An ancient prophecy foretells that the Moon Juju, the kind protector of the Pupanunu people, would be weakened by the evil Tlaloc, an embittered Pupanunu shaman, so he could turn the Pupanunu people into sheep as revenge for not being made high shaman in favor of another shaman, Jibolba. The prophecy also mentions a great and mighty warrior who would restore the Moon Juju, defeat Tlaloc, and bring peace to the Pupanunu people.[CR]Having escaped Tlaloc's spell, Jibolba believes his apprentice Lok to be the warrior of the prophecy and prepares to send him off; however, it appears that Lok has been turned into a sheep. Jibolba sends his younger apprentice, Tak (voiced by Jason Marsden), to find magical plants and change him back, though it turns out not to be Lok. Jibolba tells Tak to obtain the Spirit Rattle, which allows the wielder to communicate with powerful Juju spirits to assist him, while he finds Lok.[CR]Tak returns with the Rattle to find that Lok has been trampled to death by a herd of sheep. Jibolba has Tak collect 100 magic Yorbels and Lok's spirit from the spirit world, allowing him to successfully resurrect Lok. An unfortunate side-effect of the resurrection, however, is a severe case of diarrhea. Tak obtains the Moon Stones instead while Lok recovers, restoring the Moon Juju to full strength.[CR]The Moon Juju reveals that the warrior of the prophecy is not Lok, but Tak, as he has already fulfilled almost everything the prophecy predicted. Using his arsenal of Juju spells, Tak defeats Tlaloc and turns him into a sheep, finally fulfilling the prophecy.</plot>

		<plot>Based on the newer anime styled FOX cartoon of the same name, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles features Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo and Donatello as green ninjas. Living in the sewers, they creep out when nobody is looking to fight for truth, justice and another slice of pizza. Fighting against the public face of inventor Baxter Stockman and the more shadowy figure of Shredder and his Foot Clan, these Ninja Turtles will get the chance to make their opponents eat shell![CR]The game is a 3D beat-em-up with multiple players. The game sprites all resemble the cartoony look of the TV show and each turtle features unique moves, sound bytes and fighting style all his own. Ninja Turtle moves include a weaker/quicker attack, a stronger/slower attack, Ninja Shuriken and a Jump-Kick. There is a story mode for one or two players, and there is also a versus mode where two players can fight head to head. In the versus mode, players can fight as all 4 turtles, Splinter, Casey Jones, Hamato Yoshi, The Turtlebot, Hun, Oroku Saki, and Shredder. A Challenge mode is unlockable by defeating Oroku Saki with any Turtle in the Story Mode, which needs to be complete to unlock Hamato Yoshi and his dojo.</plot>

		<plot>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Smash-Up is a 4-player 2.5D fighting game, similar to the Super Smash Bros. series. During battle, players attempt to KO opponents by depleting their life bar, knocking them off the stage or into traps. Each character has their own unique move set, with many able to perform additional techniques such as clinging to and leaping from walls. Characters are color-coded on-screen via an optional glow effect to help players keep track of their character. Like Super Smash Bros., the game features many customizable options for battles.[CR]The game stresses interaction with the environment, and stages in the game feature traps, changes to the stage itself and interactive elements.[3] Items will occasionally appear on the stage for players to collect, including life-restoring pizza and ninja skills that grant players special abilities like fire breathing and electrical shields.[CR]In addition to standard Battle Royal multiplayer battles, Smash-Up offers several other gameplay modes. Arcade features a brief story in which Splinter challenges the turtles, April O'Neil and Casey Jones to a tournament, with unique endings for each of the seven characters.

		<plot>Loved across the world for its amazing characters, explosive graphics and lightning-fast gameplay, Tekken 5 promises to deliver the next generation of blistered fingers and bleary eyes as it brings players the ultimate, most visually stunning fighting experience ever seen in a Tekken game.[CR]Tekken 5 brings back the popular cast of characters from the previous games along with three new characters for a total of 20 default characters to start, with even more to unlock as you progress in the game. The game allows players to use fight money to customize their character with various accessories such as hats, glasses and an assortment of different costumes. Each of the new characters is equipped with a variety of deadly techniques, and the returning characters have been updated with new moves and combos. New to Tekken 5 is a bonus action adventure game that unfolds a side story to the action-packed fighting sequences.[CR]After the completion of The King of Iron Fist Tournament 4, a fierce battle between father and son unfolded at Mishima Zaibatsu headquarters. Jin emerges as the victor in this battle and continues to defeat Heihachi, his grandfather - but spares both Kazuya and Heihachi's lives in honour of his mother who loved peace. Soon after Jin's departure, a swarm of Jacks arrive at Honmaru and begin to attack Heihachi and Kazuya - and in order to escape, Kazuya thrusts Heihachi into the swarm of Jacks. A great explosion destroys Honmaru, and a man watching from afar reports, "Heihachi Mishima is dead." While many presume the death of Heihachi Mishima will end the reign of Mishima Zaibatsu, an announcement is made for the fifth King of Iron Fist Tournament, with an unknown replacement to Heihachi leading the organization. The fight begins once again.</plot>

		<plot>Forget the fancy full-motion video intros of the past. The cutting-edge gameplay that is promised in the extended intros of fighting games is finally realised in Tekken Tag Tournament. This visually stunning action game contains fully rendered 3-D characters who can execute smoothly animated martial-arts moves. With polygonal characters and texture maps this real, you will end up looking for the coin slot on your PS2.[CR]With more than 30 characters to fight against or beside, this game allows you to pull off the ultimate human combo: tag-team fighting. By choosing two fighters who have broadly divergent skills, you can increase your threat to the other fighters greatly. Also, switching out fighters can give an overextended partner enough time to rest up his or her stamina for the next tag.

		<plot>During the player's investigation of the ruins of the Outpost, they will find the UFO from the film. They will also find the body of Childs, one of the survivors from the movie. Upon securing the facility, Blake is airlifted to the Norwegian research station to locate and reinforce Alpha Team after Colonel Whitely informs him that they have lost contact with the team. There Blake and his group encounter swarms of Things that slowly dwindle down his team as Blake rescues Colin and learns of a government conspiracy with Gen Inc in conducting experiments on the alien lifeforms before they began to infest the research facility. Blake learns that Whitely was behind it the whole time and even injected himself with a Cloud Virus B4 Strain. With a new group, Blake fights his way through numerous black ops and creatures before killing the transformed Whitley. The player has the assistance of a helicopter pilot, revealed to be R.J. MacReady, the hero from the original film. The ending is ambiguous, and there is speculation that MacReady is, in fact infected.</plot>

Imagination is the only height limit with Thrillville, where the fun ranges from racing on go-kart tracks you put together and playing mini-golf on courses you designed to joining friends for dozens of four-player party games, from bumper cars to arcade shoot-'em-ups. You can also tour the park on foot - a first for theme-park titles - chatting and joking with all the guests to help them out and make sure they're enjoying themselves.</plot>

		<plot>Thrillville: Off the Rails amps up the family-friendly mix of game play that made Thrillville the best-selling original children's intellectual property of 2006 with some of the most outlandish roller-coaster concepts ever imagined, as well as new ways to talk to park guests and a new array of carnival games. Off the Rails lives up to its name with 20 death-defying rides so outrageous, they inspire the same word from every park visitor who sees them: WHOA! Players build these incredible WHOA Coasters to leap from one track to another, launch through the air like cannonballs, blast through a burning rings of fire and more. A new lighthearted story ties together more than 100 missions, complete with 34 playable multiplayer theme-park games and social interaction with park guests that's better than ever. The in-depth conversations both advance the plot and suggest better ways to manage the park. But is every guest to be trusted?</plot>

		<plot>The 2008 edition in the Tiger Woods PGA series introduces enhancements and improvements to the previous version without major graphical or gameplay changes. There are new courses (Xbox 360/PS3: 5 new, 16 in total - PS2: 6 new, 18 in total) and different licensed professional golf players to choose from (21 on the Xbox 360/PS3 - 23 on the PS2/Wii).[CR]The Xbox 360, PS2, PS3 and Windows versions allow players to import photos to create in-game faces on the characters based on custom images, using the Xbox Live Vision camera, PlayStation EyeToy, PlayStation Eye or a webcam. Further customizations include clothing, hair or eye color and more. The initial statistics can be improved by completing challenges based on power or putting precision. They can also be raised by performing well in the PGA Tour, taking into account skill shots and not just the overall ranking. Players can unlock additional golfers and spend their winnings in the shop on new equipment.[CR]The game incorporates the FedExCup championship format (a collection of tournaments) with rounds of golf at Westchester Country Club, TPC Boston, Cog Hill, and East Lake. The putt preview has been improved, allowing the player to simulate the ball's path once per individual spot, taking into accounts elements such as power, speed and elevation. On the Xbox 360 and the PS3, shots are not performed using the analog stick, but with the 3-point timed principle for start, power and accuracy. Shot Confidence is a new addition, keeping track of the player's performance on certain courses, for specific puts and using certain clubs. Great performances raise the confidence, which translates into experience and better performance on specific courses. Low confidence leads to lower accuracy, a pumping heartbeat, and rumbling controls on the Wii.[CR]The multiplayer (up to 4 players) has been expanded with GamerNet, where players can create and play custom challenges with their scores posted online (Xbox 360/PS3/Windows).[CR]On the Wii, players can shake the controls to taunt the opponents with 4 different moves, to throw them off. It can be used to influence air conditions, spin, or adds audio distractions. The controls are available in 3 modes: Full Swing (wii remote), Sitting Swing (new, waggle the wii remote) or the classic controls using the nunchuck for analog play. In Full Swing, twisting the wii remote adds hooks and slices prior to shots. Also exclusive to the Wii is a Miniputt mode.</plot>

The player can choose between two click and the True Swing controls: in the former the player needs to click two respectively three times in the right timing to set the hit conditions and in the latter the player simulates the hit movement with the analog stick. There are overall 27 licensed players and 20 courses.</plot>

		<plot>A year after the film, Jack Skellington once again feels Halloween has become dull and repetitive. He talks with Dr. Finkelstein improving the next Halloween with new scares and discoveries. The doctor gives Jack the "Soul Robber", a green, whip-like weapon. He then leaves to look for new frights; remembering his lesson from before, Jack searches solely in his world. Equally bored Lock, Shock, and Barrel revive Oogie Boogie, who brainwashes Dr. Finkelstein into creating minions for him. Oogie also kidnaps five of the seven Holiday World leaders. Oogie plans to become the "Seven-Holidays King" once he takes control of Christmas Town. But on December 23, Sally manages to send a magical paper airplane to find Jack to warn him of what has happened.[CR]Jack returns to Halloween Town on Christmas Eve, just to find Oogie's shadow. After defeating the shadow, he is given the Halloween Holiday Door and finds everyone was deceived by Oogie into boobytrapping the town.[CR]Jack learns Sally is imprisoned in a crypt, fighting through Oogie's minions to the graveyard. Once in the crypt, he finds Sally when a giant spider clings her to the ceiling and attacks Jack. Jack defeats the spider, saves Sally and receives the Valentine's Holiday Door. When Jack and Sally walk out of the crypt, she gives Jack an idea to use his Pumpkin King powers to defeat Oogie's monsters.[CR]Sally then says she's worried about Dr. Finklestein and Jack goes to find him. Inside the doctor's lab, Jack finds the brainwashed doctor, who attacks him. Jack returns the doctor to normal by switching his brain back. Jack then goes to the Mayor's courtyard to save the Vampire Brothers. Each vampire gives Jack a key to the mayor's house. Jack finds the mayor and stops Lock, Shock, and Barrel; however, they drop him into a huge maze filled with booby traps. Jack escapes the maze and asks the mayor to release the holiday leaders.[CR]Jack soon realizes Oogie wants to kill Santa, and travels to Christmas Town. Jack rescues Santa from a train-contraption, but Oogie, having become enraged by Jack constantly foiling his plans, leaves in Santa's sleigh full of Christmas presents. Luckily, Sally brings Jack's sleigh to help, and Jack and Santa chase after Oogie. Oogie falls out of the sleigh into a world of garbage after being frightened by one of Jack's jack-in-the-boxes that was dropped in the sleigh by an elf. There, he absorbs the waste and insects in the environment in a fit of rage and becomes a giant version of himself to beat Jack. Jack faces Oogie one-on-one. Oogie spills out his bugs, becoming nothing more than an empty husk, ending his threat for good. Afterward, Jack apologizes to Santa for almost ruining Christmas again, but having a change of heart about the skeleton, Santa thanks him for saving his life.[CR]Afterwards, Jack realizes that his home and loved ones are something more important than new discoveries. The story ends in much the same way as the film does, with Jack and Sally embracing on top of Spiral Hill.</plot>

		<plot>Crisis Zone is a spin-off of the popular Time Crisis arcade shooters, released in 29 March 1999 in the arcades.[CR]A PlayStation 2 (PS2) remake of the game was released in 2004 in the UK and the US with more detailed polygons and textures, higher difficulty, redone voice acting and an additional mission taking place six months after the Crisis Zone Arcade mode.[CR]The PS2 port is compatible with the GunCon (G-Con 45 in Europe) and Guncon 2 lightgun, and is available with an unusual two-player cooperative gameplay mode named "two-gun mode" by allowing two players to play simultaneously on a single-player mode without the use of split-screen, or weapon switching system (similar to Time Crisis 3, with some changes) allowing the player to switch between a fully automatic machine gun, a standard 8-round handgun and a 6-round shotgun, depending on settings.[CR]Unlike Time Crisis 3 and Time Crisis 4, where only the handgun has unlimited ammunition and other weapons are replenished by shooting certain enemies, all weapons now have unlimited ammunition in Crisis Zone, though they all must be reloaded. As with the PlayStation 2 version of Time Crisis II and Time Crisis 3, players can access the Crisis Mission exercise menu through prolonged gameplay. The US version of the PS2 remake is called Time Crisis: Crisis Zone.</plot>

		<plot>In the year 2401 the space marine Sergeant Cortez is leaving the space station that he visited in the end of his previous journey. He soon discovers that the crystals he has found can power up a time machine. After having located traces of TimeSplitter activities in various time periods on the Earth, Cortez boards the time machine and travels to these periods, hoping to aid various characters in their battles against evil.[CR]TimeSplitters: Future Perfect is a first-person shooter in which players battle their way through thirteen story missions spread across six time periods, either alone or cooperatively. The protagonist's arsenal varies depending on the time period he travels to: for example, traveling to 1924 will allow Cortez to wield World War I weapons; a Soviet setting in the 1960's contains various local firearms of that time period; stages that take place in the future feature corresponding futuristic weaponry, etc. In addition to fast-paced shooting gameplay there are also some stealth and vehicle-driving segments.[CR]Like in the previous installments of the series, various multiplayer modes are included. Players can take on computer-controlled opponents on any of the fifteen arcade maps, or make their own ones. Players can also compete for awards in dozens of arcade league matches and challenges. It is possible to choose from between 150 characters and challenge other players to a head-to-head battle, either with up to four-player split screen or online and LAN play.</plot>

As in previous Ghost Recon games, players command their team of Ghosts while neutralizing hostile forces and completing various mission objectives. These objectives can range from escorting friendly units across the map to rescuing hostages or taking out enemy artillery.[CR]Being a tactical shooter, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter places emphasis on using cover effectively in order to stay alive, together with sound strategic co-ordination to successfully complete mission objectives. A new feature is the Integrated Warfighter System, a system based upon the Future Force Warrior program.[CR]Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2, the game's direct sequel, was released a year later, in 200</plot>

		<plot>The year is 2009, and jungles of Cuba never had this kinda heat... and tension. Revolution is taking place as a drug-funded warlord is prepping to take control over the territory. A group of six elite US Army Green Berets, better known as Ghosts are deployed and ready to mess up the plans for the badguys. Aside from singleplayer campaigns, game also features split screen play and several different multiplayer modes for online play.[CR]The game also includes Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Island Thunder campaign just to encompass the conflict and give players what was amiss for PlayStation 2 before. Controlling Alpha and Bravo teams of three-by-three, you are now able to give commands to both of your teams via USB headset while fighting first-hand through the use of a gamepad. Voice-recognition supports about 50 different commands given in a way of concatenation WHO+WHAT+WHERE (e.g. Alpha Team Take Cover, or All Teams Attack Objective 2).</plot>

		<plot>Set in the not too distant future, Japan creates the Information Self-Defense Force (I-SDF). The creation of this force is seen as a violation of international law and Japan's constitution, and it causes tensions to rise between Japan, China, and North Korea. In time, North Korea and China set up shipping blockades around Japan, and Japan calls on the United States for help, citing article nine of the Postwar Constitution. Throughout this time, Japan uncovers more and more information that the infamous Black Gold Day was caused by intentional information warfare attacks. As the U.S. prepares to launch the USS Clarence E. Walsh, Third Echelon sends the famous Sam Fisher on a mission that appears to be unrelated to the incident, but which may end up being the most important element of it all.[CR]In Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, players take on the role of field operative Sam Fisher for a third outing. Fisher has some new moves this time around, and he also has a new weapon always at his disposal; a combat knife. Utilizing the knife, Sam can either kill his enemies, or simply knock them out. At the end of each mission, the player is given an overview of how they did. The more people that the player spares, the better the success score.[CR]The single-player game is more open-ended than the past two Splinter Cell games. While players are still forced through some areas in a "tunnel" like fashion, with no choice of where to go, there are many instances where they can decide how they'd like to get there. For example, in the caverns, one can either kill two enemies and cross the bridge, or leave them alone, sneak along the side path, and climb a ladder at the end, bypassing the fight entirely, but still winding up in the same location.[CR]Throughout the game many different locations are visited, such as a lighthouse, a Japanese tea house, Seoul, New York City during an East Coast blackout, and other such exotic locales.[CR]The Spies-vs-Mercs multiplayer mode that appeared in the previous game has returned, with some new features. There are several new, large maps to play on, as well as updated versions from the past game. The PC, PlayStation 2, and Xbox versions feature this mode.</plot>

		<plot>This game saw the introduction of the revert, a trick that enabled vert combos to be tied together with a manual, by tapping a button when landing in a quarterpipe. This allowed for much longer combos than in the previous two games, where landing in a quarterpipe would finish a combo. The game also added hidden combos. These were variations on standard tricks that could be performed as grab, flip, lip, or grind tricks. For example, double-tapping the kickflip button would, naturally, make the character perform a double kickflip.</plot>

		<plot>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a game based on the movie of the same name. Set a few years after the defeat of Megatron in the first game/movie, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen reveals that the threat from the Decepticons has in fact, far from ended. Since the end of the first movie Decepticons have began popping up again all over Earth. They are in search of a mysterious object from space that will gift the balance of power.[CR]The game is a linear third-person shooter that puts the player in control of many of the main characters from the movie, shifting between both Autobot and Decepticon factions. The storyline is told via cutscenes that also allow for the player to easily transition from one character to the other. Playable characters on the Autobot side include: Optimus Prime, Iron Hide, Jetfire, Bumblebee. The Decepticon side includes: Starscream, Sideways (a new character), and Megatron.[CR]Though the game doesn’t allow transform wherever the player wants to, transformation has been introduced as special attacks during robot mode, as fixed alternate game modes (driving Shanghai tunnels as Sideways, and fly through the skies of Russia as Starscream) and, in both robot and vehicle modes, as special moves that give the player alternate abilities. For example, transforming as Starscream while flying will enable him to fly backwards as a robot to take out enemies behind the protagonist.[CR]For multiplayer, at any point during a single-player campaign a friend can join in as a "Remote Weapon System", which allows them to shoot enemies, erect a shield to defend and transfer energon between both players.</plot>

		<plot>Tecmo presents TRAPT for the PS2, a puzzle-based game that contains a number of horror elements in its interesting storyline. The game is a continuation of the KAGERO: Deception series that began on the Playstation, but players aren't required to play the original games to understand TRAPT. The storyline begins when Princess Allura is framed for killing her father. As she flees the castle, players learn her dark secret: she's possessed by a demon known as Fiend. Fiend allows Allura to set a number of different traps to kill people, giving Fiend souls to survive off of. As the storyline progresses, players learn more about Fiend and how he came to possess the princess. The gameplay in TRAPT is very unique. As Allura, players run around the room setting traps while avoiding enemies. Once up to nine traps are set, they can be activated once an enemy is near. The traps come in a number of different types, including floor traps like bombs, wall traps like spikes, and ceiling traps like metal balls. Once players understand the system, they can start laying out traps in a way that an enemy will be hit by several at once to create a combo. Of course, it isn't quite that simple: some enemies are immune to certain traps, and some rooms contain areas where traps can't be placed. TRAPT weaves together unique characters, horror elements, and a fun, different gameplay style to create a unique game that will provide hours of challenge.</plot>

Failing a mission still allows the player to continue playing through the chapter and undertake subsequent missions; in some cases this will lead to branching paths and optional missions. However, in order to complete the whole chapter the player must eventually succeed in all the main missions.</plot>

		<plot>The story revolves around the Planet Mischief, where there is a tradition that once someone turns 3-years old, he/she must travel to a planet and learn how to perform "Mischief" and cause panic on that planet. Cosmi, a three-year old alien, travels to Earth for his mission, in order to impress his father, the Master of Mischief, Cosmi Sr., mostly because Earth is considered the greatest challenge. Cosmi crashes with a TV satellite from a town called Coco Town. When crash landing, he manages to hide in an alley on Coco Town, where he is saved by Earth's Mischief Master, Master Itazura. He takes him to his Dojo to train, and lets Cosmi move on with his mission, on 8 different locations: CocoTown, HighStakesHill, Pranksyvania, PharaohIsland, BigBootyBay, FrontiersVille, RaccoonCity and finally Cosmopolis. It is revealed that Cosmopolis is a trap for "Anti-Alien-Forces" to capture all of the aliens on Earth by disguising themselves as aliens. Itazura uses their trap as the final challenge for Cosmi, and challenges him personally there. Cosmi wins and travels back to Planet Mischief to celebrate, but crashes into another TV-station and crashlands on Earth again, this time, in the middle of CocoTown square. Of course, panic arises and reporters try to get a snapshot of the little alien, but Cosmi accidentally pushes someones camera around, causing it to take a photo of the crowd, thus revealing that several of them are also aliens.</plot>

		<plot>Unlimited SaGa" is a sequel to Square's famous series of non-linear RPGs. Like in the early Romancing Saga games, and in Saga Frontier, you assume the role of eight main characters (selectable at the beginning of the game). The story centers around Laura, a 30-year old widow and an ex-pirate, but you view the story and make it progress differently depending on which character you have chosen, and on the decisions you take throughout the game. Each character is represented by a different kind of flower.[CR]"Unlimited SaGa" feels and plays a lot like a classic board RPG. Everything - from disarming traps to hitting the enemy successfully in a battle - depends on the so-called REEL system. You have to stop a spinning slot machine at the right time, in order to perform an action successfully. It is similar to the classic dice system in pen-and-paper RPGs, and to the Judgment Ring system in Shadow Hearts. You can explore the world in a non-linear fashion, visit many optional areas and fight monsters at your will. Some puzzles have multiple solutions and can be solved by using a character's special skill. For example, a character with a Swim skill can cross a river and reach the next area of the game.</plot>

		<rom name="ps2-redump-usa-chd-part-V/Valkyrie Profile 2 - Silmeria (USA).chd" size="3746592813"/>
		<plot>Hundreds of years before Lenneth's tale, another saga lies concealed by the gods. The valkyrie Silmeria once served Odin loyally, but after an incident ignited a conflict between them, Odin forcefully reincarnated her as a human. The human soul that would carry her spirit was that of Alicia, Princess of Dipan. Ordinarily, Silmeria-s consciousness would have been sealed, her spirit dormant until she was next summoned... However, the forced transmigration causes Silmeria's spirit to awaken within Alicia, leaving two souls to inhabit a single body. The spirit that should have been sealed has awakened-a situation Odin will not ignore for long. This installment introduces the new Photon Action System to the classic side-scrolling action format found in the original. Projecting photons grants players more freedom to explore and expands the action, resulting in challenging puzzles with clever solutions. Add to that "sealstones" that affect the laws of nature in dungeons, launching strategy to new heights. The unique battle system of the previous game has evolved into the Advanced Tactical Combination Battle System.</plot>

The story takes place in an alternate version of the year 2006 in France, when progress looks stuck in the late 19th century.[CR]Michel and Albert rescue a 12-year-old girl named Caroline who witnessed a couple of villagers held hostage by the vampire sarcoma. After rescuing the villagers and Caroline, the vampire hunters proceed into the castle to destroy the remaining forces of dark.[CR]Although the forces of evil reveal that they created Michel and Albert to kill themselves, they became afraid of death and tried to stop them. It is important to note the Hunters are in fact Dhampyrs (half-vampires), foreshadowed by their glowing eyes and sunglasses. The outcome is a pyrrhic victory for the forces of good; as the forces of evil are stopped, the Vampire Hunters decide to let the rising sun end their own lives as well.[CR]The game ends with Caroline paying her respects to the Vampire Hunters at their graves.</plot>

		<plot>Van Helsing is able to pick up various weapons, to complete the quest. Each weapon, except the elephant gun, has its own ammunition upgrades. An ammo bar indicates how much of the upgraded ammo can be used. [CR]Regular ammo is unlimited and use of regular ammo increases the amount of upgraded ammo length. Van Helsing can collect up to three life replenishers, three ammo replenishers and three speed boosts. After every five kills, Van Helsing is able to perform a "finishing move" which will kill the sixth enemy with one hit. Special enemies such as any of the brides, Velkan the werewolf, Dracula or Igor have no response to a finishing move. The list of enemies that Van Helsing encounters during the length of the game include skeletons, flying skulls, small werewolves, skeletons armed with swords, bats, Dracula's children, stone statues, etc. along with the main enemies. .</plot>

		<plot>The 2008 edition in the Smackdown vs. Raw series holds new features to the WWE game franchise. This is the first in the series to include the extremists of ECW, including The Sandman, Marcus Cor Von and CM Punk.[CR]The game also features a new struggle submission system, new weapon choices including guitars, and eight superstar fighting styles, including Showman, Powerhouse, High-Flyer and more. Each player can now choose a primary and a secondary fighting style. It continues the legend trend and new arenas, such as Wrestlemania 23, Unforgiven and Summerslam as well as the classic superstars like Undertaker, Shawn Michaels and Ric Flair. The roster largely depends on the platform, and some versions include wrestlers not available in the other ones.</plot>

		<plot>WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011 is a professional wrestling video game that is based on the two brands of WWE, Raw and SmackDown.[CR]One of the main changes in the game is the incorporation of a new physics system that allows objects to be used more realistically, such as objects involved in the Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match. Tables now break differently depending on the impact placed upon them. Inside and outside the ring, ladders can now be rested onto the ring ropes and be broken in half. For the first time since the original WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw game, chairs can be thrown at your opponents.[CR]The Hell in a Cell match is revamped with expanded cell walls, weapons underneath the ring, steel steps near the poles, and the cell door is removed. In addition, the game adds new ways to escape the steel cage.</plot>

		<plot>Wakeboarding is part of Activision's line of Extreme Sports titles. A rider (using a board that's like a combination of a surf board, body board and skateboard) is pulled along the water by rope at high speeds by the boat up front, and must pull of tricks either by jumping of jumps or using the wake left by the boat itself (hence the sport's name).[CR]Unleashed takes this sport and turns it upside down, allowing you to fly down water ways through well known locations around the world, pulling stunts off buildings or cliff faces. Other objectives are included that have you completing tasks and busting tricks in a unique way.[CR]Multiplayer modes include one-on-one trick attack and horse, where both players compete against each other to pull off the best tricks. Co-operative mode has one player driving the boat while the other hangs on behind, with new challenges for the boat driver to complete as well as the rider.</plot>

		<plot>In War of the Monsters, players take the roles of large monsters in city environments. The game plays as a fighting game yet works differently than the traditional one-on-one structured rounds. Instead, fights can include up to 4 players in a four-way simultaneous fighting structure. The camera is in third person perspective, allowing the player to focus solely on their character.[CR]Monsters have two status bars in each game, health and stamina. Like the standard fighting game formula, every time a monster takes damage, their overall Health bar drops until it is completely depleted, resulting in player defeat. Stamina determines how much energy a monster can attack with. The bar drops if a monster picks up another foe or performs a ranged attack. If the bar is full, a monster can perform special attacks, whereas if the bar is completely drained, they become temporarily immobilized.</plot>

The player controls only Spanx, using Redmond as a weapon or tool as the situation requires. Spanx has most standard platforming abilities, while Redmond is completely indestructible as a result of tests conducted upon him and so can be hurled into security guards, jammed into machinery, and used as a grappling hook, among other uses. Redmond can be inserted into special outlets to be set on fire, frozen, or become radioactive.</plot>

		<plot>Although it is essentially a remake of the original PlayStation version of Wild Arms, Alter Code F brings enhanced gameplay, improved graphics, and an expanded storyline to the PS2. Players take command of three unlikely companions in a surreal and desolate world called Filgaia. The young orphan Rudy has a unique ability to physically bond with "ARMs," or "Ancient Relic Machines," which seem to have been left behind by a forgotten civilization. The runaway princess Cecelia can command forces of magic, and the swordsman Jack is adept at a number of trades. These three "Dream Chasers" seek their fortunes in the unforgiving countryside, and might just end up saving the whole world along the way. The role-playing adventure includes overworld exploration and intense dungeon-crawling. Wild ARMs: Alter Code F is compatible with the PlayStation 2 HDD, so veteran PS2 gamers with older model consoles and the hard drive accessory can load the large, two-DVD game program to disk in order to decrease load times.</plot>

Freedom's last hope rests in the hands of three new operatives, who must race against time to recover this doomsday device. The fate of the world hangs by a thread, and a few ticks of the clock means the difference between justice and annihilation. WINBACK 2 brings to the series a new "route" system that lets players experience each mission from the perspective of different operatives. There are 30 intense missions, multiple difficulty levels, and new weapons including the highly-anticipated sniper rifle. The new Winback assault team is comprised of three young, yet combat-proven operatives led by Craig Contrell. Each team member is qualified in six different weapon types and highly-adept at CQB (Close Quarter Battle). They are masters of target identification, engagement and shot placement. In the hands of the player, all of these techniques will be put to the test. The game's unique shooting action is spread across 30 high-risk operations situated in challenging urban environments and conveyances.</plot>

		<plot>Pro Evolution Soccer 6 enters the display of 2006/2007 with up-to-date exchange of club and national players. Some new clubs were brought to their proper names (such as Manchester United instead of Man Red), while others have lose it (such as Chelsea which is now once again London FC). However, despite the names, players are correct as Chelsea does have Ballack and Schevchenko, Real Madrid now has Van Nistelrooy which was in Manchester United and so on.[CR]Controls are the same, but moves and strategies have changed, as they tend to do from game to game. Fouls are not as easygoing as in previous game, but players turning is now too slow unless you know how to do it properly. Moves are much more realistic and goal keepers don't catch every ball with an ease, even easy one can sometimes slip by. That said, it all makes one step closer to reality, while it loses the reality factor on some other sides. Cameras are typical broadcast, tower, and bird-perspective, and cups, league and master league are still included.[CR]The Xbox 360 version is the only one to have hi-definition graphics and more animations, as the PC version is a conversion of the PS2 engine. The 360 version lacks a few features however, such as co-operative play, the PES shop, a replay save feature and some minor settings such as the ability to create players, rename leagues, edit kits, team names, boots and player appearances, and you cannot swap kit combinations.</plot>

		<plot>Following previous winter sports titles (including the official game of the Torino 2006 Olympic Games), 49Games presents another light simulation of some of the most popular winter sports, including alpine skiing, snowboard half-pipe, ski jump, speed skating, biathlon, luge, bobsleigh, skeleton, figure skating and curling, for a total of 18 different events.[CR]While not as complex as the specialized games developed by the German company (there's no waxing the skis, for instance), the game features a solid physics engine, which provides more realism than some of the more arcadish approaches to the genre. Gameplay varies by event, with the player being in full control of the athlete in most events like alpine skiing and half-pipe (which plays like most radical sports games featuring tricks and flicks instead of being "on-rails"), while other modes feature an higher focus on rhythm, like speed skating and figure skating. Curling plays like most games previously featuring the event, but there are two modes: simulation plays like the actual sport, where a team scores a point for each stone closer to the middle than the opponents' closest, while game awards points for each of the stones inside the target.[CR]The game features three modes: Competition, where the player can participate in 5, 9 or all 16 events (or customize them), Campaign, where the player has to complete a number of quick goals to unlock additional tracks and features from previous games, while Career requires the player to compete in 15 levels with an increasing number of events to do the same. Single Events allow the player to train on any event.</plot>

		<plot>WipEout Fusion is a futuristic racing game with action elements. Playing compete in the F9000 Anti-Gravity Race League, driving hovercrafts and sometimes using weapons against opponents to achieve victory.[CR]Like WipEout 3, the game contains single-race and league modes, as well as two-player split screen gameplay. The single race mode (called Arcade) is used to unlock new tracks. The challenge mode from WipEout 64 returns with a few enhancements: each team has its own set of six challenges, which must be completed with a medal in order to unlock the next one. A new Zone mode requires players to drive as many loops as possible on a track while continuously increasing the speed.[CR]Another new feature in WipEout Fusion are hovercraft upgrades. Depending on their performance, players receive credits after races, which can be used to increase speed, thrust, weapon power, shield strength, lateral stability, and brake force of a vehicle. Upgraded vehicles can be used in any other game mode, with the exception of the Challenge mode.</plot>

		<plot>All of the action in Without Warning takes place over the course of a 12-hour period. Terrorists have infiltrated a chemical plant and a three-man team gets inside to take them down. Along the way there are three civilians that play a role in the operation as well. One is a security guard, another is a secretary, and the third is a cameraman who survived a crash in his news chopper after it was hit by a surface-to-air missile from the terrorists. The cameraman wants to get the story and survive while everyone else wants to get out of there and save as many hostages spread across the plant as possible. There are six playable characters in all, but the trick is that none of them really interact with each other directly. However, there will be several times where characters see others or the results of their actions during their own segment, such as seeing a firefight from afar.</plot>

		<plot>World Destruction League: Thunder Tanks is a car combat shooter game that has a similar gameplay to the Twisted Metal and Vigilante 8 series. Like Twisted Metal and Vigilante 8, the player must obtain "powerups" and defeat enemy vehicles, but must capture the enemy flags in order to win. However, all of the vehicles are tanks, hence its name. The game itself is short, making it quite unpopular among gamers. It was also one of the very first PlayStation 2 titles to be released. It is considered a spiritual successor to the Battletanx series, since it has similar gameplay to that as well, and is made by the same company, 3DO. Also a mototank from Battletanx: Global Assault can be seen in the opening title sequence, and many of the playable tanks are inspired or directly copied from Battletanx. A reversed M-80 (only in the PS1 version of Battletanx: Global Assault) can also be seen in game as the unplayable AI controlled Skorpion Bomb Tank.</plot>

The objective of most of the matches is to eliminate the opposing forces' worms, whereas the Campaign mode gives the player sets of specific goals which he needs to complete.[CR]The campaign consists of 35 small missions in which the player has to utilise their worms to complete a certain task, like destroy enemy worms, collect a certain crate, or even unique missions, like having to detonate 16 hidden landmines in a certain time. All of the missions give awards depending on how well you do. Gold medals usually unlock bonuses as for example maps, challenge missions, infos about weapons or voice banks. In the challenge missions in you have to use a weapon/utility to collect targets that add to your timebank which increases steadily. Getting a gold medal here unlocks maps or locked weapons.</plot>

		<plot>The control system of the game is heavily influenced by other popular fighting titles, such as Street Fighter, Dead or Alive, or Darkstalkers. The gameplay mechanics are tailored to a very gradual learning curve: super attacks are performed by pressing two punch or kick buttons simultaneously, and multi-hit combos can be executed by pressing the punch and kick buttons in a particular order (a feature similar to Darkstalkers' chain combos). The game features an extensive combo system, including normal chains, air juggles, and air launchers. In addition to the basic blocking system, players have various counter attacks available to them that can be executed by simply pressing the counterattack button and a direction on the controller. The counter-attacks are specific to the type of attack the player is countering.[CR]The fighting stages are fully 3-D rendered stages with their own layouts. As in Dead or Alive it is possible to knock an opponent to a different part of the stage, which functions as its own individual stage. In the X-Mansion, for example, an opponent can be knocked from the Hangar to the Hallway, then to the outer courtyard where, after the 2nd round, the basketball court opens up, allowing a player to be knocked back into the Hangar.[CR]While in Story Mode, only a limited set of characters are available for each battle; Arcade Mode allows you to select from any of the playable characters in a series of eight battles. The Two-Player Versus Mode also allows players to choose from any of the unlocked characters. The game also features a Survival Mode, in which a single player is pitted against a never-ending flow of computer-controlled opponents in a test of endurance.</plot>

		<plot>Professor Xavier asks the X-Men to return to Alkali Lake to retrieve irreplaceable parts to Cerebro. Nightcrawler is asked to infiltrate the remnants of William Stryker's base with his teleportation ability, since the weapons systems were somehow operational. Once inside, he finds out that Stryker had a backup plan to destroy the mutants — mutant hunting robots called Sentinels. Working together, Storm and Wolverine find an A.I. module for a Sentinel when agents of HYDRA (an organization of terrorists) arrive to take the remaining Sentinels to their own base. It is revealed that HYDRA had designed the robots for Stryker. Inside the base, Wolverine discovers that HYDRA had employed one of his former adversaries — Lady Deathstrike, who was able to survive an apparent death in X2 after being pumped full of adamantium.</plot>

		<plot>X-Men Origins takes influences from games such as God of War and Devil May Cry with a third person perspective. The Uncaged Edition also features a large amount of blood and gore. Enemies can be dismembered in several ways in addition to the graphic display of Wolverine's healing factor.[CR]Combat relies on three options - light attacks, heavy attacks, and grabs. Another form of attack is the lunge, which allows Wolverine to quickly close the distance to an enemy. Wolverine can also use the environment to his advantage, such as by impaling foes on spikes. During combat, Wolverine's rage meter builds up, and when full allows him to use more devastating attacks, like the claw spin and a berserker mode, which increases Wolverine's claw strength until his Rage Meter empties. Experience (XP) is collected from defeating enemies, destroying elements and accumulating collectibles. The XP is used to level up, and each new level results in gaining skill points, which are used to purchase upgrades.[CR]The PlayStation 2 and Wii versions are less graphic, with less language and slightly different combat. Feral senses are still obtained, which can detect doors, traps, enemies and sentinel observers, and lunges must be performed at closer distances.</plot>

		<plot>XGIII: Extreme G Racing is a futuristic racing game. Six teams are competing to win a racing championship, the player taking control of any of the two riders available in each team. The game retains the action elements of the previous titles: as before, opponents will try to sabotage the race, and the player-controlled character is able to answer them with his own arsenal of weapons.[CR]Unlike the previous installments, weapons cannot be picked up on the road: the player has to purchase them with the money earned after a successful race. All weapons now deplete the player's weapon bar with each shot. Another change is the absence of the "nitro" boosts utilized in the previous entries; they have been replaced with a turbo system, where using the boost drains energy from the player character's shields.</plot>

		<plot>Xenosaga: Episode I - Der Wille zur Macht, the first chapter of a trilogy, is a Japanese-style sci-fi role-playing game, sharing many common themes and gameplay elements with Xenogears. The battle system is not unlike the one used in Xenogears (combo attacks, AP and EP gauges, etc.), but random encounters are eliminated. Instead, the enemies are now visible and battles can be avoided. During combat the few upcoming ally and enemy turns are shown onscreen, allowing the player to make strategic decisions based on who will act next. A rolling slot moves with each turn as well, conferring a bonus such as added damage or bonus XP for any action on that turn. If the enemy would be in position to take an advantage then the player can expend a character's "boost" gauge to cut in and act next, although enemies can boost as well, and enemy boosts always over-ride player boosts. [CR]Each character has a unique tree of Ether spells they can learn by spending Ether points earned in battle, with lower spells requiring spells above them to be purchased first. After a spell is purchased, so long is it does not require a unique talent of that character, the spell can also be purchased and learned by any other character that can afford double its normal cost. The Anti-Gnosis Weapon Systems can be equipped with different weapons and accessories and can be used in combat provided that a character has enough AP on that turn to board their AGWS.</plot>

Despite this victory, Kazuma has lost more than he had ever imagined. [CR]But events from the past continue to haunt him. A man he had admired so much, who was like a father to him, has revealed a terrible secret before he died. It's time for Kazuma to solve the mystery once and for all. Caught in the eternal fight between Kantou and Kansai, the Eastern and the Western organized crime groups of Japan, he soon realizes that there are other powers on the stage, including a mysterious Korean organization that seems to be connected somehow to his past.[CR]The sequel to Yakuza continues the story from the previous game, featuring many recurrent characters. The main gameplay idea also remains the same - on-foot exploration of urban environments, hand-to-hand fighting, and role-playing elements, somewhat similar to the kind of gameplay that was introduced in Shenmue games. The sequel features some technical improvements, such as the ability to rotate the camera during the fights. It also contains more side missions and mini-games, ranging from playing pool and mahjong to running a club and dating women.</plot>

		<plot>This 3D board game consists of a series of duels, which are played with cards. The game has been split up in a Campaign Mode, in which you take on all levels of the Monster Coliseum on your own, a Free Battle Mode where you play skirmish matches against enemies defeated in the campaign, and a versus mode to take on a human opponent. Before starting, you have to choose a symbol, assign parameters to it (based on monster points, action points and power points) and buy a starter kit card deck.[CR]In a typical campaign game, you start in the entrance hall, where you manage your cards and monsters. To duel, you choose one of the four areas with five levels each, and defeat the opponents. New monsters are acquired by winning the match. The turn-based duels are played as a card game. Both characters start with a deck of cards and a number of health points. When a health status reaches zero, the battle is over. You attack your opponent by summoning monsters and assigning abilities to them. Trick cards can be used to gain both offensive and defensive advantages. Before each duel, you have to pick a monster that is up for ante, and the fighting is influenced by various parameters, including the land form you are playing on.</plot>

		<plot>The game begins with Dingo Egret, the protagonist, working at a mining facility on Callisto. He inadvertently discovers the Orbital Frame, Jehuty, that was hidden there by Leo. When he is attacked by BAHRAM forces who have come to seize it, Dingo climbs into Jehuty and engages the attackers. During the battle, Dingo enters the BAHRAM battleship, seemingly defeating Nephtis, an Orbital Frame controlled by an A.I. program based on Viola's fighting style, but is subdued by Anubis, Jehuty's superior counterpart controlled by Col. Ridley (Nohman) Hardiman, leader of BAHRAM.[CR]As a prisoner, Dingo is assaulted by Ken Marinaris, a female Orbital Frame runner that Dingo defeated in the previous battle. Nohman arrives moments later and asks Dingo to join him. When Dingo refuses, Nohman shoots him, ordering Ken to dispose of the body. Instead, Ken has Dingo revived and placed inside Jehuty. When he comes to, she explains that Jehuty is acting as a life-support system, and if he leaves Jehuty, he will die. She then tells him that she is a UNSF spy. Dingo escapes with Taper and heads for Mars.</plot>

		<plot>Gauntlet: Dark Legacy is the follow-up to Gauntlet: Legends and another installment in the long-running Gauntlet series of hack-and-slash action games. As with all the Gauntlet games, you play a medieval fantasy character who, along with allies if you have them, fights his or her way through hordes of evil creatures on the never ending quest for more gold and perhaps even an eventual goal. [CR]This version contains the characters and levels from Gauntlet: Legends, plus the new characters and levels from the Dark Legacy arcade game, with a few extra levels thrown in.[CR]There are eight characters to initially choose from: the mighty Warrior, the deadly Valkyrie, the quick-footed Archer, the powerful Wizard, the spellcasting Sorceress, the stalwart Knight, the valiant Dwarf, and the chaotic Jester. Although there are similarities between characters from the two games, each character looks and plays differently. In addition, there are eight alternative-modes for these characters to unlock, plus dozens of secret characters to obtain. With a multi-tap, up to four players can play, with rules governing how much they can hurt each other. Unlike the original Gauntlets, the levels you'll face take place in various terrain from forests to mountains to volcanic plains. Many of the monsters are familiar to old fans of the series, but there are some new blood among the ranks of evil, including some rather large foes.</plot>

		<plot>Gauntlet is back for yet another iteration. The Emperor has crucified his four loyal heroes to a magic tree, driven by a maniac thirst for their immortality. Hundreds of years later, as only a ghost, he came to regret all the wrong deeds he has done and frees them, asking them to defeat his six former advisors in an attempt to undo what he has done.[CR]This version of Gauntlet goes back to the roots: The warrior, valkyrie, elf, and wizard fight their way through hordes of enemies to make their way to the six bosses. The game is mostly a hack'n'slash affair, puzzles are limited to finding keys and pressing buttons that open doors and portals. Every character has a unique set of moves and attacks: The warrior has rather powerful attacks, the valkyrie has quick moves, the elf can shoot powerful arrows, and the wizard has several magical range attacks.[CR]Defeating enemies gives you experience points that may be used to increase your three stats; some chests in the levels contain better armor or weapons. Also, new moves can be purchased with gold.[CR]The game can be played both in single-player as well as cooperative multi-player, where up to four players fight together.[CR]The newest feature of this game (other than the much better graphics) is the online gaming feature. Played online, the game is identical to a regular multiplayer game, with each player on a different box.</plot>

		<plot>Genji: Dawn of the Samurai is a third-person action role-playing game (RPG) set in medieval Japan around the 12th century. At the time, a clan called the Heishi has conquered most of Japan through supernatural means. These means refer to magical stones called the Amahagane which bring supernatural powers (called the Kamui) to the wearers. The hero of this saga is a young man called Yoshitsune, a samurai who also possesses an Amahagane. The game starts when young Yoshitsune is attacked by the Heishi as they are searching for other Amahagane stones. The fate of the world depends on those who controls these magical stones and at that moment, the Heishi seem invincible as they posses most Amahagane. Later in the story, the player acquire a second hero, the giant warrior monk Benkei, who also owns an Amahagane. The story then revolves around the struggles of these two unlikely heroes against the tyranny of the Heishi clan.</plot>

		<plot>Players take the role of George from the popular cartoon show, George of the Jungle, in a 3D side scrolling action-adventure. Players swing, climb, and platform their way through the jungle in search of the missing documents which could hold the key to the "secret" medical mystery. The camera views and turns show the 3D view, but essentially the game is played as a 2D platformer with a linear path on a single plane. Often George needs to manipulate objects in the environment, for instance moving boxes to create a platform, to continue.</plot>

		<plot>Mark Hammond is an ex-gangster who wants to forget his past and live honestly with his wife and little son. Everything goes horribly wrong when London's most vicious criminal, the organized crime boss Charlie Jolson, decides that he needs Mark's services and obtains them in a twisted and cruel way: Mark's wife is murdered, he is framed for this murder, and his child gets kidnapped. [CR]Jolson makes it clear: unless Mark does what he orders him to do, the boy dies. Using the helpless man in his plan to bring down other criminal organizations of the city, Jolson sends Mark on suicidal missions during which Mark has three terrible choices: walk away and lose his son, get killed in a battle against overwhelming odds, or single-handedly help Jolson to get rid of his adversaries.[CR]Once the player completes Mark Hammond's story, a new scenario opens, in which the player controls Frank Carter, a vigilante cop who won't stop until he brings Charlie Jolson to justice. Frank's scenario is parallel to Mark's, shedding more light on events that remain somewhat unexplained during Mark's scenario.</plot>

There are many different weapons available for use, and after defeating enemies you may be able to pick up extra ammo or weapons; occasionally you will also acquire a hacking key. With this, you will be able to see the location of other enemies in the area onscreen. You will also be able to attempt to hack certain enemies; when attempting to hack, two spinning rings appear on the screen. If you successfully match up the ring patterns, you will be able to control the enemies actions. Computer terminals can also be found in many areas allowing you to hack into enemies.

		<plot>What started as a simple report of strange lights at an abandoned school has become something much more for rookie cop Lazarus Jones. After unwittingly unleashing hundreds of ghosts from a containment facility, including one that took a liking to Lazarus' partner, it's now his job to travel to the four corners of the earth and recapture them. This is going to be one long night.[CR]Lazarus starts the game with a pistol, but bullets aren't much use against the incorporeal. Eventually he will find energy weapons that can drain away a ghost's energy, and when a ghost has been sufficiently weakened it can be captured with Lazarus' homing "Ghost Grenade". Not all the monsters Lazarus faces are the undead, however, and more solid foes can be dispatched the traditional way: shooting them until they stop moving. Levels are traveled through sequentially and range from flooded bayous to a sunken battleship and abandoned prison island. Sometimes Lazarus will be assisted by a mute ghost named Astral who can reach areas beyond Lazarus and open paths for him. She has to be careful however as she has no way to attack or defend herself.</plot>

		<plot>This action/adventure/combat game makes powerful use of the darkly imaginative world of Ancient Greek mythology, where the realms of the mortal and the divine collide in a pervasive atmosphere of brute force and violence. Playing as Kratos, throughout the game players will wield double blades bound to his body by long chains, weapons symbolic of this vicious world to which he is bound and the fate from which he seeks to escape. Featuring an hour of cinematic sequences and a deep combat system incorporating context-sensitive actions and an extensive range of combos, GOD OF WAR takes players through various environments that will have them fighting fierce enemies, swinging on ropes, scaling mountain cliffs, swimming through rivers and sliding down zip lines. The result is a unique and thrilling adventure through Greek mythology.</plot>

		<plot>The player takes on the role of Tommy Vercetti, a man who was released from prison in 1986 after serving 15 years for killing eleven people. The leader of the organization for whom he used to work, Sonny Forelli, fears that Tommy's presence in Liberty City will heighten tensions and bring unwanted attention upon his organization's criminal activities. To prevent this, Sonny ostensibly "promotes" Tommy and sends him to Vice City to act as their buyer for a series of cocaine deals.[7] During Tommy's first meeting with the drug dealers, an ambush by an unknown party results in the death of Tommy's bodyguards, Harry and Lee, and the cocaine dealer. There is another survivor, the pilot of the dealer's helicopter, who flies off and escapes. Tommy narrowly escapes with his life, but he loses both the Forelli's money and the cocaine.</plot>

		<plot>Vice City Stories is a prequel to Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (2 years earlier) and it is the sequel to Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories. Set in 1984, players take on the role of Vic Vance, an army soldier who loves his country, family, and himself. One bad decision turns everything around and he is kicked onto the streets of a tough city. He has to build an empire to survive, or be left to die. Together with his brother Lance, a drug addict, the siblings try to take over Vice City.[CR]Just like other GTA titles, gameplay consists of third-person shooting and driving sequences in an open environment. You will meet new enemies and gangs, and old foes. The missions require you to kill with a selection of weapons, steal vehicles such as a car, a boat, or a plane, rob to make it big, or just to have fun.</plot>

		<plot>The player character has robbed the Liberty City Bank with his girlfriend, Catalina, and a male accomplice. While running from the scene, Catalina turns to him and utters, "Sorry, babe, I'm an ambitious girl and you ... you're just small-time". She shoots him and leaves him to die in an alley; the accomplice is also seen lying nearby. It soon becomes apparent that the player character has survived but has been arrested and subsequently found guilty and sentenced to jail. While he is being transferred, an attack on the police convoy aimed at kidnapping an unrelated prisoner sets him free.</plot>

		<plot>The Spirits, who once protected the world, have gone loose. Running around wildly, they created monsters who disturbed the peace in the world and provoked two mighty nations to start an all-destroying war. After years of battles and pain, the two nations finally decided to sign a peace agreement. Now they wish concentrate together on hunting down and eliminating the insane Spirits. You control a young boy named Evan, who wants to become a Ranger (a fighter who possesses unique abilities), like his father. But before he can be initiated as a Ranger, he has to fulfill an important mission and help to save his world from the Spirits.[CR]Grandia Xtreme is the first Grandia game to be originally released for Playstation 2. Its combat system is virtually the same as in the previous two games, a mixture of strategic planning and combo attacks. Your party members can run around, avoid enemy attacks, and their attack power depends on their distance from the enemies. Grandia Xtreme is heavily based on combat, with more dungeons, more fighting, and less story than the two previous installments of the series.</plot>

		<plot>Gravity Games Bike is a BMX video game, and features gameplay similar to that of the Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX games. It features 21 characters and 10 levels. The player controls a BMX biker, and is required to complete various goals within levels to unlock later courses. As the player performs tricks, they gain more points and fulfill requirements in the game. The control scheme is similar to that of the Dave Mirra games in that one button on the controller is used to perform tricks, and another is used to modify the trick once it's performed. Unlike other similar games, Gravity Games Bike rewards the same amount of points for performing the same trick repeatedly. The game has several different multiplayer modes</plot>

		<plot>Guitar Hero: Aerosmith is a music rhythm game developed by Neversoft, published by Activision and distributed by RedOctane. It was released on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles, with Budcat Creations solely developing the PlayStation 2 port, Vicarious Visions solely developing the Wii port, and Aspyr Media solely publishing the Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X ports. The game was released on June 26, 2008 in Europe, on June 29, 2008 in North America, August 6, 2008 in Australia and October 9, 2008 in Japan. Guitar Hero: Aerosmith sold as both a bundle with a specially designed guitar controller as well as a game-only package.[CR]The game is considered an expansion in the Guitar Hero series, extending upon the general features of Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. As with other games in the series, the player uses a guitar-shaped controller to simulate the playing of rock music by playing in-time to scrolling notes on-screen. It is the first game in the series to primarily focus on the work of one rock band, with Aerosmith songs comprising approximately 60% of the soundtrack, while the remaining songs are from bands that have been influenced by or opened for Aerosmith. The single player Career mode allows the player to follow the history of the band through several real-world-inspired venues, interspersed with interviews from the band members about their past. Aerosmith re-recorded four songs for this game, and have participated in a motion capture session to create their in-game appearances. Guitar Hero: Aerosmith is the final installment of the series to only feature guitar and bass as possible instrument choices. The next entry (Guitar Hero World Tour) would introduce other roles to create a full band experience.[CR]While Guitar Hero: Aerosmith maintains the same gameplay as past Guitar Hero games, it has received criticism for being shorter and easier than the previous Guitar Hero titles and difficult to justify its price point; furthermore, with the game's strong focus on one band, reviewers felt that the game's ultimate enjoyment rested on the player's appreciation for the music of Aerosmith.</plot>

		<plot>his title largely borrows from the novelties introduced in Guitar Hero: World Tour, with band career modes for single or multiple players with a storyline drawn as a cartoon, competitive modes online, and the possibility to play with different instruments such as a regular guitar, a bass guitar, drums, and doing the vocals. The storyline describes how a band wants to follow in the footsteps of the Metallica and become a leading act on their tour. This edition adds an Expert+ difficulty mode where players need to drum using a second bass pedal to mimic the playing style of Lars Ulrich, the drummer of the band. The members also did motion capture sessions for the avatars in the game.[CR]The music selection consists of 28 master recordings and 21 additional songs by others selected by the band. Bonus features include various videos and trivia about the songs. Progress is made by completing sets of songs, rather than a series of gigs as in Guitar Hero: World Tour, set in venues that were in important in the band's career. Performances are rated with stars and a certain amount is needed to progress and unlock a new set.[CR]The game also includes the GHTunes from World Tour where new songs can be created and shared. A new Drum Mode offers the possibility to play the drums without an existing drum track to create new rhythms, and the Battle mode (from Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock), has been updated with Metallica influences for the power-ups, with names like Fade To Black, Under The Ice and Ride The Lightning.</plot>

		<plot>Guitar Hero Smash Hits (titled Guitar Hero Greatest Hits in Europe and Australia) is a music rhythm game and the fourth expansion game to the Guitar Hero series. The game features 48 songs originally featured in five previous games in the series—Guitar Hero, Guitar Hero II, Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s, Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock and Guitar Hero: Aerosmith—redesigning the songs to be based on master recordings and to include support for full band play first introduced to the series in Guitar Hero World Tour. The game was developed by Beenox, published by Activision and distributed by RedOctane for release on the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360 systems and was released around the world in the second half of June 2009.[CR]The game reuses many elements from previous titles in the series, including Guitar Hero World Tour and Guitar Hero: Metallica. Beenox designed the game around playing the greatest songs of the series at venues located in the greatest places on Earth, and created venues based on various Wonders of the World for the game. While the game's soundtrack and expansion into a four-player band were well received by reviewers, the game was highly criticized for being a full-cost standalone title instead of being downloadable content for existing games in the series.</plot>

		<plot>Guitar Hero: Van Halen is similar to the preceding band-centric game, Guitar Hero: Metallica, featuring support for four players in a single band on lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game is based on the engine originating from Guitar Hero World Tour, and thus does not feature the additions that are present in Guitar Hero 5, such as drop-in/drop-out play.[4][CR]Only the current members of the band—Eddie Van Halen, David Lee Roth, Alex Van Halen and Wolfgang Van Halen—are playable avatars in the game for the Van Halen songs; former band members Sammy Hagar, Gary Cherone and Michael Anthony are not included.[4][5][6] The band appear as they did in 2009 but, by completing challenges in the game, players can unlock their older appearances from the "spandex era […] with the big hair and tight pants".[4][7] Despite not being alive during this period of the band's history, Wolfgang Van Halen's avatar has a retro outfit copied from the dice-shirt-and-patchwork-jeans getup worn by his father in the video for "Panama".[CR]A demo of the game was released to Xbox Live on December 9, 2009, featuring two Van Halen songs, "Eruption" and "Panama", along with Weezer's "Dope Nose" and Killswitch Engage's "The End of Heartache</plot>

		<plot>Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s (titled Guitar Hero: Rocks the 80s in Europe)[4] is a music rhythm game and the third installment in the popular Guitar Hero series. It was released in July 2007 in North America and Europe, and in August 2007 in Australia.[CR]Players use a guitar-shaped controller (purchased separately) to simulate playing rock music by hitting notes as they scroll towards the player. Rocks the 80s is an incremental title in the Guitar Hero series, rather than a full sequel. No changes in gameplay from Guitar Hero II have been introduced to this game. As implied by the game's title, the game features a 1980s theme, consisting of songs from the decade and playable characters, fashions, and artwork that reflect the time period.[CR]The game was not as well-received as the prior two Guitar Hero games, due to the lack of new gameplay features and reduced soundtrack. Rocks the 80s is the third and final title in the Guitar Hero series to be developed by Harmonix before they moved on to create Rock Band.[5] The next major installment of the series, Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, was developed by Activision's Neversoft division.[6]</plot>

		<plot>Guitar Hero II, the follow-up to the PS2-only game Guitar Hero, expands upon the gameplay and features of the original game. As a wannabe rockstar, you need to play songs by pressing combinations of five fret buttons on a guitar-shaped controller, while working the strum bar, along with an optional whammy bar for distortion. The sequel contains 64 songs, of which 40 have been licensed. One of the tracks was discovered through a contest at beaguitarhero.com, where unlicensed bands could send in a demo to be included in the game. Most of the tracks have been covered in-studio, but a few use original recordings.</plot>
